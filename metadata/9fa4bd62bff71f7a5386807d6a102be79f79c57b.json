External Wi-Fi adapters are not supported.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ready for El Capitan.\n\nAlso:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixes filtering so that ',' corresponds to &quot;OR&quot; and '&amp;' to &quot;AND&quot; when filtering networks using multiple fields.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixes filtering so that RSSI levels in dBm can be entered as a valid filter option (e.g. &quot;&gt;=-82&quot;, &quot;&gt;-70&quot;).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixes import of annotations when using lowercase BSSIDs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Adds filtering by signal strength using the keyboard, for example, press '9' to display networks with signal strength &gt;= 90% (or -90 dBm if using dBm as unit for signal strength), '8': &gt;= 80% (or -80 dBm), '7': &gt;= 70% (or -70 dBm) and so on. Press '0' to clear filter and display all networks. Keys below numbers ('Q', 'W', 'E', etc.) gives you intermediate values, for example, press 'T' to display networks with signal strength &gt;= 55% (or -55 dBm if using dBm as unit for signal strength).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Adds option to automatically hide 2.4 or 5 GHz section of channel graph if no networks are displayed in these frequency bands.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Integrates annotations with WiFi Signal 3.4.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Other minor bug fixes and UI improvements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa4bd62bff71f7a5386807d6a102be79f79c57b","amp;dn":"WiFi+Explorer+2.0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa4bd62bff71f7a5386807d6a102be79f79c57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,164,189,98,191,247,31,122,83,134,128,125,106,16,43,231,159,121,197,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
