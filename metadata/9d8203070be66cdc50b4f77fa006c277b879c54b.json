Certainly, Gibson's voice is engaging, conversational, winning, But Distrust That Particular Flavor needs less journalism, better writing, and more thinking. Ã¢â‚¬â€Michael Dirda --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gibson pulls off a dazzling trick. Instead of predicting the future, he finds the future all around him, mashed up with the past, and reveals our own domain to us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I forget that in addition to being a major novelist (Zero History, Neuromancer, etc.), heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the best essayists and critical observers currently operating within our sociocultural sphere. This is his first essay collection, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s messed up how good it is: raw, weird, honest, smart.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Lev Grossman, Time Entertainment \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Exquisitely written, done to a turn with both insight and that unmistakable prose that is just shy of spectacular.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦This is a fine and even essential complement to the Gibson canon, and a delight to read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€BoingBoing.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d8203070be66cdc50b4f77fa006c277b879c54b","amp;dn":"William+Gibson+-+Distrust+That+Particular+Flavor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d8203070be66cdc50b4f77fa006c277b879c54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,130,3,7,11,230,108,220,80,180,247,127,160,6,194,119,184,121,197,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
