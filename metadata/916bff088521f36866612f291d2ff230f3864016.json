Open Lucky Patcher, press menu, then press update.\n\nInstall the latest version of Link2SD from the play store.\n\nLucky Patcher has a working patch for version 3.5.2. Run it, select Link2SD, Patches, Custom Patch. Apply the patch, you should get a 70% patch success. Then launch Link2SD and all features are unlocked.\n\nNote that on my kitkat phone the function to &quot;Create Link&quot; and selecting to Link App Data, the fourth option, causes some programs to run very slowly. Be sure you have a class 10 sd card","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916bff088521f36866612f291d2ff230f3864016","amp;dn":"Link2SD%2B+Plus+3.5.2+Patched+%5BFixed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916bff088521f36866612f291d2ff230f3864016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,107,255,8,133,33,243,104,102,97,47,41,29,47,242,48,243,134,64,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
