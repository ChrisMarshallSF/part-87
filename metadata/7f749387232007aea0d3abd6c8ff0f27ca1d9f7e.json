Timescales is a varied exploration of deep, vibe-driven bass music crafted on a foundation of analog warmth and spacious, open soundscapes. Beginning with the futuristic, wide-angle perspective of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Skyline 3040Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, the album takes the listener through dub (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Musical FamilyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and soul (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Late Night FadingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) before a detour through west coast funk (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cali Trunk RattleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The tempo drops for the garage-influenced Ã¢â‚¬Å“At Most SphereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the marvelously deep Ã¢â‚¬Å“Carry TearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe tempo steps up for the title track and more dubwise styles courtsey of Ã¢â‚¬Å“TrenchtownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Power TransferÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides a nice house vibe before Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aural HygeineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ closes out the album with a dose of bass heavily influenced by 1990s atmostpheric drum &amp; bass. Rounding out the thirteen songs is a trio of downtempo interludes provides breathing room between different chapters of the record.\n\nTimescales is a reflection on growing older and becoming ever more acutely aware of timeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passing. The influences that inspired this album are now unmistakably in the past, accessible only through old recordings, writings, photos and memories. If any part of this record strikes you with nostalgic feelings, be glad that you were there to experience those times first hand. If this record sounds entirely foreign to you, we encourage you to delve into electronic musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past -- there is some amazing music waiting for you.\n\nAbout Deco \nDeco is a Los Angeles-based producer who makes bass-driven electronic music with a touch of soul. From dub to techno to downtempo and songs that defy classification, DecoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style always comes with ample amounts of vibe, whether its deep and contemplative or techy and driving. Rooted in the underground days of drum &amp; bass and dubstep, Deco wears his influences on his sleeve and blends the sounds of yesteryear with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s styles &amp; production standards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f749387232007aea0d3abd6c8ff0f27ca1d9f7e","amp;dn":"Deco+-+Timescales+%5B2013%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f749387232007aea0d3abd6c8ff0f27ca1d9f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,116,147,135,35,32,7,174,160,211,171,214,200,255,15,39,202,29,159,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
