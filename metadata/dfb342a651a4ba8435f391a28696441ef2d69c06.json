A ship that had headed to Earth with a mission and a message: Help Us. A brave new frontier beckons. But we are about to learn that it comes with a price...\n\nWithout warning, the aliens transport small groups of humans from the competing scientific communities of Houston, Texas and Bangalore, India to the vast interior habitats of Keanu. Their first challenge is to survive. Their second; to discover why The ArchitectsÃ¢â‚¬â€the unknown, unseen aliens controlling the asteroidÃ¢â‚¬â€brought them there. And soon a third emerges: they must find a way to take control of Keanu.\n\nBecause the NEO is moving againÃ¢â‚¬â€away from Earth.
