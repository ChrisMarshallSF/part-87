Its quite fun and easy to use. \nTake a photo and play with the filters.\nImages are only saved if you use the save button on the effects screen. The images will be saved on your SD card in the folder Pictures/Filtux so make sure it is activated. If you cannot save your images please contact me.\nI see that some people have problems with the camera function. Things I need to know are primarily on which devices this happens, because the only info I getting at the moment, is that this happens on the device &quot;OTHER&quot;, so it's not really helpful. ;)\n\nFilters/effects available:\n* Grey filters\n* Color-tint filters\n* Color invert\n* Intensity \n* Contrast\n* Edge &amp; Neon filters\n* Vignette filters\n* Border/Overlay options\n* Mirror filters\n* Tritone\n* Rotation\n* Exposure \n* Pointillize Effect\n* Glow Effect\n* Blur Effect\n* Water Effect \n* Color Blindness Simulation (Protanopia, Protanomaly, Deuteranopia, Deuteranomaly, Tritanopia, Tritanomaly, Achromatopsia, Achromatic)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ab82b4bba1ca10aad663cc10ea5d20cc9c3105","amp;dn":"Filtux+Android+Photo+Effects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ab82b4bba1ca10aad663cc10ea5d20cc9c3105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,171,130,180,187,161,202,16,170,214,99,204,16,234,93,32,204,156,49,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
