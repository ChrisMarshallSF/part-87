This is the fourth installment into the Jak and Daxter series, and the last Jak and Daxter game developed by Naughty Dog, which later work on Uncharted.\n\nJak X is modeled after the driving mechanics of Jak 3. Two songs by rock band Queens of the Stone Age, &quot;You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar But I Feel Like a Millionaire&quot; and &quot;A Song for the Dead&quot;, from the album Songs for the Deaf, are featured in the game's intro. Most of the in-game musical tracks were written by Dean Menta of Faith No More and Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle, which can be recognized as the darker, more ambient tracks. This was the first Jak &amp; Daxter game to feature multiplayer mode, the second being Daxter for the PlayStation Portable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093a8f33ce488f1d459af6b5b0d2eec7fa4ff473","amp;dn":"Jak+X+%28Europe%2CAustralia%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093a8f33ce488f1d459af6b5b0d2eec7fa4ff473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,58,143,51,206,72,143,29,69,154,246,181,176,210,238,199,250,79,244,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
