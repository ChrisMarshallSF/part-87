He's taking his outdated 1980s home into a whole new dimension with a full makeover Ã¢â‚¬â€ and he'll be the captain of the ship for the entire voyage. From design, to demolition, rebuilding and decorating, Shatner will go boldly into this new adventure.\n\n\n\n\nThe Shatner Project - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\nThe Kitchen (Pilot)\n\nThe Shatners create an entertainment-friendly kitchen with an updated look that has more space.\n\n\n\n\nThe Shatner Project - Season 1, Episode 2\n\n\n\nFront Patio\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Shatner have never loved the front of their 100-year-old home. The front door is tucked away, down and around the front patio, so their guests have no idea where to enter, the wrought iron trellises that are holding up the overhang are rusted and the terra cotta tiles are chipped and worn. William wants a grand first impression for his friends and family and he'll get it by completely demolishing the existing front patio and in its place building an enclosed front entry, complete with arched windows and a grand front door.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Oct-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f83e4fb909a8b9795fbcd6086fde492a4bf525b","amp;dn":"The.Shatner.Project.S01E01-E02.WS.DSR.x264-NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f83e4fb909a8b9795fbcd6086fde492a4bf525b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,131,228,251,144,154,139,151,149,251,205,96,134,253,228,146,164,191,82,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
