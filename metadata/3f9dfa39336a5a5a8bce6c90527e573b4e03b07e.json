It begins at the tail end of the Boer War, when handsome young British officer Clive Candy, recently back from the battlefront, is infuriated by his discovery that Deutschland papers have played up the British atrocities in South Africa, propagandistically. He grows so irate, in fact, that he travels to Germany to address the problem. Once there, he meets an attractive British educator, Edith Hunter (Deborah Kerr) who spends her days teaching English as a second language to German students. They grow close, but Candy so aggravates the local indigenes that he winds up in a duel with a German officer, Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook). The men wound each other and are sent to the same hospital, where they become friends. Candy - who doesn't yet realize he's fallen in love with Edith -- senses that Theo and Edith are attracted to one another, and encourages the couple's marital union. Candy subsequently returns to England, then falls for and marries Barbara (again played by Kerr), a nurse who bears a strong resemblance to Edith. She later dies, but Candy meets a third woman during WWII, Johnny (Kerr a third time), assigned to drive him from one locale to another during his campaigns. Meanwhile, Theo - disgusted by Nazi atrocities -- absconds to England, where he reencounters his old friend, now a prattering old shuffler rapidly approaching the end of his career and raving continuously about Nazi conduct (or lack thereof) in battle.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : The.Life.And.Death.Of.Colonel.Blimp.1943.720p.BluRay.FLAC.1.0.x264-LoVeRoSe.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 844 Kbps\nLength            : 9.01 GiB for 2h 44mn 22s 921ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 986 x 720 (1.369) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : FLAC\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\n\nAudio #1          : AAC\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : el\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036112/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036112/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English, Greek, Portuguese\n\nSecond commentary audio track","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9dfa39336a5a5a8bce6c90527e573b4e03b07e","amp;dn":"The.Life.And.Death.Of.Colonel.Blimp.1943.720p.BluRay.FLAC.1.0.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9dfa39336a5a5a8bce6c90527e573b4e03b07e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,157,250,57,51,106,90,90,139,206,108,144,82,126,87,59,78,3,176,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
