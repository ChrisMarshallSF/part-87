I'm sharing them because the code can be activated and downloaded only one time, and many people will lose the ringtone files somewhen, so i want to give you a chance to get them back. Or if you're a true MGS fan, you can just download these ringtones and feel like you have an iDROID ;)\n\nTo install the ringtones, you've got to copy all the m4r files to iTunes and synchronize the ringtones with your Apple iDevice. Then on your iDevice you go to settings and then sounds, so you can listen to all your new ringtones and set them up. Please post comments if you have any questions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c827c64109b5633d97be180a62911f87def69d85","amp;dn":"MGS+V+GZ+iDROID+Ringtones+for+iDevices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c827c64109b5633d97be180a62911f87def69d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,39,198,65,9,181,99,61,151,190,24,10,98,145,31,135,222,246,157,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
