And the fucking logo/hashtag would have been half missing for the ENTIRE run of the show. We did it this way DIMENSION did it the other, we don't think either one of us was wrong but this made far more sense to us.\nFurthermore we feel that PROPER is an entire load of shit, there's plenty of shows that have movie style AR for half the show or even 95% of it that still get done without being cropped Ali G does it, plenty of others as well...\n\nGet real... Honestly, how does it make sense to have the logo half cropped out for the entire run of the show, the prev on, credits and intro over-cropped as well... And this show has NEVER done this before either...\nWe're adamant that we are correct, yet we didn't proper we internaled because it's clearly a case were the rules don't cover what is right or wrong and it's a personal preference &lt;_&lt;\n\nGreetings to all the groups who choose quality, over speed and quantity!\nSpecifically 2HD, aAF, BAJSKORV, CTU, DIMENSION, EVOLVE, FEVER, FQM, KILLERS, KYR, LOL, SYS and YesTV.\nValediction to ASAP, CRiMSON,EXCELLENCE, IMMERSE, LMAO, OMiCRON, REMARKABLE, SWOLLED, W4F, XII and XOR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de228ff37a82ee5c0cfa104d50aeb4278e94ccd","amp;dn":"Z.Nation.S01E07.READNFO.INTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-BATV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de228ff37a82ee5c0cfa104d50aeb4278e94ccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,226,40,255,55,168,46,229,192,207,161,4,213,10,235,66,120,233,76,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
