In the meantime, they have released a remastered version of their debut album Ordo Ab Pax.\n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is louder, heavier, and cleaner than the original release, and the best part is that it is free for everyone to download. We will also be re-releasing a remastered version of our EP followed shortly by our next full length in a couple of months.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ~ Yuri Zager (bass &amp; vocals, Arx)\n\nThe band, established in 2011, has been relatively quiet on the live scene on account of an active writing and recording schedule. Following their debut album in April of 2013, they also release an EP titled History Repeats Itself in that year.\n\nHistory Repeats Itself was a particularly interesting project in that the band chose to record and release their own tribute to other South African bands, past and present, and some of which members of Arx originated from. Examples of tracks released on the EP include: Ã¢â‚¬ËœIllusionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ originally by Dementia; Ã¢â‚¬ËœHuman NatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ originally by MUNK; Ã¢â‚¬ËœDie RejectedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ originally by Mind Assault; Ã¢â‚¬ËœCalm Before the StormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ originally by Battalyon, midst other tracks.\n\nThere's little info to be found on this band, nor for their latest release .. However they do mention on their well known Social Media site page their influences include Iron Maiden, In Flames, Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, Carcass and Sentenced. they mention, they are a DIY band through and through, self written material, self recorded albums and self promoted. their aim is to fuse old school and modern metal with a unique flavour drawing on the influences of a very wide range of well versed metal and rock bands. The first two albums are available to download for free, and the next album will be called The Speed of Dark and will be released in 2014.Oh you mean this album that I am`editing, so yes it is released by me today I hope you enjoy it.  \n\n\n\n\n\nLine-up:\nYuri Zager - Bass/Vocals\nJoseph Scheel - Guitar\nChristopher Blake - Guitar\nLouis Schalkwyk - Drums\n\n\nDiscography:\nOrdo Ab Pax     20 April 2013\nHistory Repeats Itself     28 October 2013\nOrdo Ab Pax  [Remastered]    04 September 2014  \nHistory Repeats Itself  [Remastered]    20 September 2014\nSpeed Of Dark     26 October 2014\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
