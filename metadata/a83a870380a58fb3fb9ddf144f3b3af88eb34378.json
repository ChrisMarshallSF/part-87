Ã¢â‚¬ËœLet Us Burn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elements &amp; Hydra Live In ConcertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is set for release on November 14 and features two of WITHIN TEMPTATIONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most talked about arena shows ever. The two dates are 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s resplendent 15th birthday Ã¢â‚¬ËœElementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ concert and the final night of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHydraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ European arena tour at AmsterdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heineken Music Hall in May 2014. When it comes to the live experience, Within TemptationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status is of a league extraordinaire. These two performances showcase every nuance of their fierce reputation plus stunning imagery and special FX, including even giant fire-breathing dragons!\n\nIn November 2012, WITHIN TEMPTATION challenged themselves to create one of their most impressive arena shows ever, to celebrate the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 15th birthday. The result was the one-off symphonic Ã¢â‚¬ËœElementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ show, held at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp. A dazzling event with 15,000 fans, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream came to life. Newly inspired, the group went forth to write their critically acclaimed sixth studio album Ã¢â‚¬ËœHydraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIn early 2014, WITHIN TEMPTATION unleashed Ã¢â‚¬ËœHydraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. This monster record claimed more than 10 European Top-10 chart positions, a #2 position in the iTunes World Charts, and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest US Billboard Top-20 chart position to date. The album success was followed by a 33-date European arena tour, selling out noted venues like Wembley Arena in London, Le Zenith in Paris, and the legendary Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam (twice).\nOver 15,000 fans joined the Ã¢â‚¬ËœElementsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ show celebrations and more than 120,000 fans witnessed the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHydraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ beast on stage in Europe, but WITHIN TEMPTATION is far from done. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœHydraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ world tour is currently in full swing in North America. With South America and Japan still to come, more than half a million fans will have seen WITHIN TEMPTATION by the end of this year.\n\nWITHIN TEMPTATION is renowned for releasing impressive live DVDs. Previous release, the best-selling Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack SymphonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DVD, helped make them one of the most popular bands in their genre. At their recent Awards show in Berlin, Metal Hammer Germany presented WITHIN TEMPTATION with the prestigious Best Live Band Award. The new DVD underlines this title.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLet Us Burn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elements &amp; Hydra Live In ConcertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will be released in four formats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DVD + 2CD, Blu-ray + 2CD, 2CD, and digital album. The DVD and Blu-ray contain 34 live audio visual tracks in HD, mixed in 5.1 Dolby Surround. The 2CD and digital album comprise 32 live audio tracks. The two shows have a running time total of approximately 170 minutes.
