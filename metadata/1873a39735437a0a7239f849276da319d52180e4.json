If you're feeling rebellious, you can also choose the side of the Zeon and face off against the forces of the E.F.F. The action runs fairly fast and both the nunchuk and Wiimote are used to control the Gundam and push into battlefields and duel one-on-one against foes. In addition to melee attacks and gunfire, a sniper mode is available where a targeting scope allows players to focus in one the head of an enemy mech and blow it off to disable it entirely. There are times when two energy blades meet and they'll sizzle as each swinger tries to gain the upper hand in the sword face-off. When running and gunning, the Wiimote controls a targeting cursor which may be positioned inside a center reticule to hit enemy soldiers dead-on. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/R79JAF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gametdb.com/Wii/R79JAF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMost of my 1500+ Wii games are listed here (not all yet) (text file format directory listing)                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://textuploader.com/koes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://textuploader.com/koes&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck it out and see if there's a game you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\n\nID......R79JAF\nregion..NTSC-J\ntype....Wii\n\nlanguages\tJA\ndeveloper.......Namco Bandai Games\npublisher.......Namco Bandai Games\n\ngenre...........action\nrating\tA\nplayers\t2\nreq. accessories...wiimote, nunchuk\n\nrelease date....2007-7-26","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1873a39735437a0a7239f849276da319d52180e4","amp;dn":"Mobile+Suit+Gundam%3A+MS+Sensen+0079+%5BR79JAF%5D+%28wbfs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1873a39735437a0a7239f849276da319d52180e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,115,163,151,53,67,122,10,114,57,248,73,39,109,163,25,213,33,128,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
