He has written three novels, three collections of short stories, a collection of novellas, and seven volumes of essays, three of which have won National Book Critics Circle Award prizes and one of which, A Temple of Texts (2006), won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism. His 1995 novel The Tunnel received the American Book Award.\n\n'Though much of Gass's central aesthetic has remained constant, there have been gradual shifts in his views of metaphor and ontology of the text. His view of metaphor is far more expansive than that proposed in his dissertation [A Philosophical Investigation of Metaphor]. Gass tells LeClair that &quot;[m]etaphor has been thought to be a pet of language, a peculiar relation between subject and predicate . . . [b]ut you can make metaphors by juxtaposing objects and in lots of other ways&quot; (Paris Review). In other words, metaphor need not be a purely linguistic matter, and perhaps not surprisingly Gass's change in his explanation of metaphor from graduate school to now signals a change in the focus of his fiction. As noted earlier Gass claims to construct self-contained systems of ideas, but in these interviews, one can trace a growing concern with the relationship of his fiction to the world, as he makes clear to LeClair: &quot;I've been principally interested in establishing the relationship between fiction and the world. If we can see that relationship as a metaphorical one, then we are already several steps in the direction of our models.&quot;'\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* A Temple of Texts: Essays\n\n* Cartesian Sonata and Other Novella\n\n* Finding a Form\n\n* Life Sentences\n\n* Middle C\n\n* Omensetter's Luck\n\n* On Being Blue\n\n* Reading Rilke\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.readinggass.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.readinggass.org&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/13/william-h-gass-how-i-write.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/13/william-h-gass-how-i-write.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3576/the-art-of-fiction-no-65-william-gass&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3576/the-art-of-fiction-no-65-william-gass&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Gass&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Gass&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nNote:\n\nGass told me in my dream that to wait until December would be too long and boring for readers, so here it is.
