The files get encrypted and can be accessed with the correct password.  It is different than a compressed encrypted archive because each file can be randomly accessed.  Think of it as an encrypted virtual usb storage device.\n\n&quot;Admiral Smith&quot; of United States of America.\nReviewed 09-29-2014\nDisclaimer:\nThe image [Admiral Smith - United States of America].jpg was a cute little clean furry image that I wanted to use as a commissioned stamp.  Each file that I review is comissioned in my database with a zero dollar value which means it is used for inventory purposes.  Why yes.  I may write off my storage bank off on my taxes.  I do not need to but that is what good commissioners do.  It is a new era of commissioners, custodians, and pickers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nText from the product.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHIDE YOUR FILES AND KEEP INTRUDERS OUT\n\nSafeHouse Explorer hides and protects your private documents and files, keeping them safe from intruders and anyone else who doesn't have your permission to view them.
