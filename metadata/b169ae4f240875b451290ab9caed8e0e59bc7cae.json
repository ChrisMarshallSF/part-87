With their powers based on chaos and order, Hawk is an agent of anger and unpredictable behavior while Dove is a hero based on calmness and strategy. Together, they use their contradictory abilities and styles to fight against injustice wherever it appears. In HAWK AND DOVE these two dissimilar heroes meet for the first time and work together against Kestrel, a super-powered villain intent on the destruction of Hawk.\n\nThanks goes to OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O for this release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b169ae4f240875b451290ab9caed8e0e59bc7cae","amp;dn":"Hawk+and+Dove+01-05+%281988-10%29+%28digital%29+%28OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O.-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b169ae4f240875b451290ab9caed8e0e59bc7cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,105,174,79,36,8,117,180,81,41,10,185,202,237,142,14,89,188,124,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
