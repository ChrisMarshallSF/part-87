Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  \nEarly this morning of October 14th, 1808, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.\n\nThis is a very early playable build.
