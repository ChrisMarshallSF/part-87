All three videos appear to be well-produced, with good quality sound and lighting.\n\nCantlie described himself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“long-term prisonerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and went on to criticise US president Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy for air strikes to defeat IS fighters.\t\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAcekAaGh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAcekAaGh&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 1  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11131269/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11131269/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 2  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11132694/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11132694/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 3  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11199218/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11199218/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 4 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11230772/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_4.mp4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11230772/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_4.mp4&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0872d8141d8cf15d24612f1dfb1788aee239a3e","amp;dn":"Lend+Me+Your+Ears+-+Messages+from+the+British+Detainee+John+Cant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0872d8141d8cf15d24612f1dfb1788aee239a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,135,45,129,65,216,207,21,210,70,18,241,223,177,120,138,238,35,154,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
