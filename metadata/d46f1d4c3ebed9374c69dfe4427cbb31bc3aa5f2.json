This makes updating at a later time very flexible. The GUI is created in XML and can be integrated into the application independently. This is a superior technology that is only rising in popularity now!\n\nYou will also learn how to integrate data in the program with the object model. This touches Object Oriented Programming. I will not specifically teach OOP, but if you follow what I show you, you will understand it easily.\n\nEverything you need for this course is freely available. I will not try to sell you something.\n\n\nMy Promise to you:\n\nEvery single video in this course is dense learning material without distraction. No promotion, no endless Introduction. I will get straight to the point, but teach you everything from Step 1.\n\n\nEVERYONE CAN LEARN TO CODE\n\nRequirements:\n\nLittle to no experience in programming (Java or other language)\nHungriness to learn crazy coding skills\nInterest in learning new technical skills\n\nIt is very likely that you know the basics of Java at the end of this course. So practically you learn 2 things in one!\n\nAll tools that you need for the development with JavaFX, are freely available and I will show you in detail how you download and install them.\n\n\n3 Reasons for taking this course:\n\nThorough Teaching: I will share knowledge with you that took myself years to learn.\nIndividual Support: If you are stuck, I help you personally as soon as I can.\nTechnical Excellence: All videos are 720HD quality.
