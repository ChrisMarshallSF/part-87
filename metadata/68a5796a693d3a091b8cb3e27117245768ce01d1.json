They gathered this force by participating in some split albums with other polish bands like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wolf SpiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“StosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DestroyersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the first one. Two songs were contributed to this album by Dragon: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Demon WojnyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Siedem czasz gniewuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This split album came to light in 1987. On the same year, they released a new split album, this time only with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wolf SpiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metalmania Ã¢â‚¬â„¢87Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. The next year, the second volume came out, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metal Mania Ã¢â‚¬â„¢88Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ had some other bands participating on it, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“TurboÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DestroyersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wolf SpiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HammerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cydhie GenosideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Dragon contributed two songs to this album: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Horda GogaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which would be the name of their first full-length album, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Planeta Ã…Å¡mierciÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n1989 was the year that saw them finally releasing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Horda GogaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, first full-length album of the band. It contained 9 songs and was released under Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metal Master RecordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Lineup was Marek Wojcieski in vocals, Jarek Gronowski and Leszek Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jakubowski in guitars, Krystian Ã¢â‚¬Å“BomberÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bytom in drums, and Krzysztof Ã¢â‚¬Å“ZigaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nowak in bass.\n\nMarek left the band and another vocalist came to record their second full-length, entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fallen AngelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. His name was Adrian Frelich. Bassist Grzegorz Ã¢â‚¬Å“DemonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mroczek was the second new member to the band, replacing Krzysztof Nowak.\n\nGoing on with the same pace, by releasing one album per year, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scream Of DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in 1991, under a new label, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under One FlagÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. 12 songs (including 2 instrumentals) were contained on this one. The lineup also changed on this new release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jakubowski left the band and Jarek Gronowski had to record both main and rhythmic guitars.\n\nIn 1994, under Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baron RecordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, they released a cassette containing 19 songs. A Cassette? What is that? And their last album to date is Ã¢â‚¬Å“TwarzeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, released in 1999, containing 10 songs, and this time under the label Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metal Mind ProductionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Tomasz DaÃ…â€žczak was the new drummer for this album, and Tomasz Woryna the new bass player. The band split up in 2000.\n\nThere are plans for a reunion, from Jaroslaw Gronowski, Adrian Frelich and Krystian Bytom (new drummer). They want to reissue all of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full-length albums and a new DVD from a festival in Jarocin. They also have plans on recording a brand new album. How? Will they do it on cassette?\n\nIn 2013, Marek Wojcieski, first singer for the band, passed away on September 8th, at the age of 46.Much to young ...but Im still wondering what is cassette?\n\nimage (pictures of cassete tapes with tape coming out,and pencil trying to reroll) Oh those things UGH!\n\nBand Members (Last known lineup)\n\nAdrian Frelich Vocals\nJarosÃ…â€šaw Gronowski Guitars\nTomasz DaÃ…â€žczak Drums\nTomasz Woryna Bass\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nHorda Goga (1989)\n\nimage\n\n01 - The Priest Of Betray\n02 - Seven Bowls Of Wrath\n03 - Eternal Rest\n04 - Beliar\n05 - Horde Of Gog\n06 - Cerveza\n07 - Innocent Blood\n08 - Here Comes The Dragon\n09 - Armageddon\n\n\n\nFallen Angel (1990)\nimage\n\n\n01 - Fallen Angel\n02 - I Spit In Your Face\n03 - Tears Of Satan\n04 - Deceived\n05 - Simon Peter\n06 - Destructor - Sewer Of Graves\n07 - Into The Dark\n08 - Crying Woman\n\n\n\nScream of Death (1991)\n\nimage\n\n01 - Mutant\n02 - Memory\n03 - Altars Of Doom\n04 - Gallery Of Void\n05 - Alley Of\n06 - Forgotten By Death\n07 - Scream Of Death\n08 - Prisoner\n09 - Song Of Darkness\n10 - Final Introduction\n11 - Ashes Of A Generation\n12 - Demon Of War\n\n\n\nSacrifice (1994) (192kbps)\n\nimage\n\n01 - Pozytywka-Intro\n02 - Return\n03 - Etiude I\n04 - Looking For The Death\n05 - Etiude II\n06 - Living And Suffering\n07 - Spell Of Recollection\n08 - Etiude III\n09 - The Mystic\n10 - Death From Agony\n11 - The Route Of Unworthy Rest\n12 - Time For ''The Last Farewell''\n13 - Etiude IV\n14 - 4.W.O.W.\n15 - Crying Woman\n16 - Etiude V\n17 - Sacrifice\n18 - Yog-Sothoth\n19 - Negatywka\n\n\n\nTwarze (1999) (192kbps)\n\nimage\n\n01 - Zapach Nocy\n02 - No Ale Co\n03 - Puste Miejsce\n04 - Dzien Po Dniu\n05 - H-Iv\n06 - Sex I Falsz\n07 - 4 Wdw\n08 - Podarunek\n09 - ...To Jest Istotne\n10 - Lustra\n\n\n\nAll albums in 320kbps, except where noted\n\n\n\nGenre: Death\nSubgenre: Death / Thrash Metal\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 447.60 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n58 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a5796a693d3a091b8cb3e27117245768ce01d1","amp;dn":"Dragon+%28POL%29+-+Discography+%281989-1999%29+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a5796a693d3a091b8cb3e27117245768ce01d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,165,121,106,105,61,58,9,27,140,179,226,113,23,36,87,104,206,1,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
