The game itself can be compared to the movie Gravity, with all the flying around in space and all the things that go wrong. It will also show you how difficult it is to fly around in zero G while trying to perform difficult tasks. The result is a hillarious and partly frustrating game with a lot of uncontrolled spinning around. Features:\n \nFun and silly gameplay\nSwedish astronauts\nRepair breaking ships\nOutrun an exploding sun\nCrash stuff\nJetpack madness\nAchievements\nSecret missions\nAnd much, much more! \n\n\nNOTE:\n\nI have x64 / Linux / OSX versions as well, I will upload the x64 version after this torrent is healthy; I will only upload Linux or OSX by request.\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaCCnaAgK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaCCnaAgK&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you can afford a few bucks, please support the developer and buy the game, he seems to know what he's doing with Unity, so it would be good to see more games made by him.\n\n\n\nPlease seed for others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1064344e491653d65e6dbd54ecd32b420ce777b2","amp;dn":"IN+SPAAACE%21+%28x86%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1064344e491653d65e6dbd54ecd32b420ce777b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,100,52,78,73,22,83,214,94,109,189,84,236,211,43,66,12,231,119,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
