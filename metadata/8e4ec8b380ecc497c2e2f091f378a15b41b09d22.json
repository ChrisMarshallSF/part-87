The airman glows and disintegrates. Meanwhile, David Vincent is in Maine, trying to find a fisherman who is in possession of an alien disk. After his bizarre experience, Captain Mitchell Ross wants David to testify with him before a committee. But David knows that talk will do no good: he needs that alien disk. Later, the aliens abduct David and take him on a trip into their space ship. Incredibly, they want to convince him that they have only peaceful intentions. To prove it, they show him how they've revived and replenished a dying desert valley. But all is not what it seems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e4ec8b380ecc497c2e2f091f378a15b41b09d22","amp;dn":"The+Invaders+Season+1+Ep.+10+-+The+Innocent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e4ec8b380ecc497c2e2f091f378a15b41b09d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,78,200,179,128,236,196,151,194,226,240,145,243,120,161,91,65,176,157,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
