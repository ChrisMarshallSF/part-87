Asking Naruto to kill him as he failed Zabuza, revealing that he inherited his ability from his mother, Haku reveals that he once lived in the Land of Water where people with Kekkei Genkai are forced to conceal their powers out of fear of persecution. When HakuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father learned of his power, he killed HakuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother and forced Haku to subconsciously invoke his powers to kill his father and the angry mob. Some time after, Haku was founded by Zabuza and trained to hone his skills to be of use to the swordsman. Meanwhile, having sensed Naruto only released a fraction of the Nine TailsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chakra, Kakashi summons a number of dogs to find and restrain Zabuza. At that time, Haku manages to convince Naruto to kill him before seeing Kakashi about to finish Zabuza off with his Lightning Blade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ed5512872ea61a36506e079ce400953e3e0537","amp;dn":"Naruto+Episode+17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ed5512872ea61a36506e079ce400953e3e0537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,237,85,18,135,46,166,26,54,80,110,7,156,228,0,149,62,62,5,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
