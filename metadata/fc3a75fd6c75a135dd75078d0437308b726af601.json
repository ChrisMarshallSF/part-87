And yet I must tell you in advance that this recording of the Op. 6 Concerti Grossi of Handel is the exact opposite of a so called 'period performance'. These recordings were made in the late 1960s by Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic over the course  of a few summer vacations together (!) They were released on 3 CDs in the early 1990s by DG.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc3a75fd6c75a135dd75078d0437308b726af601","amp;dn":"Handel+-+Concerti+Grossi%2C+Op.+6+-+Karajan%2C+BPO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc3a75fd6c75a135dd75078d0437308b726af601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,58,117,253,108,117,161,53,221,117,7,141,4,55,48,139,114,106,246,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
