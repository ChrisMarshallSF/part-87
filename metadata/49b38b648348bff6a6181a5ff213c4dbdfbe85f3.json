Following Naruto, who is the first person who does not see him as the Hokage's grandson, Konohamaru asks him to teach him the transformation jutsu that Naruto was using on Hiruzen: The Sexy Jutsu. In the process, Konohamaru reveals his own reasons to become Hokage and his desire to be seen as his own person. Eventually, the two are found by Konohamaru's mentor Ebisu, who sees Naruto as a bad influence with the confrontation ending with Naruto using Ebisu's hormones against him by combining his Sexy Jutsu and the Shadow Clone Jutsu to produce the overwhelming Harem Jutsu. Through Naruto's influence, Konohamaru is able to accept that he cannot follow in his grandfather's footsteps by his name alone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49b38b648348bff6a6181a5ff213c4dbdfbe85f3","amp;dn":"Naruto+Episode+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49b38b648348bff6a6181a5ff213c4dbdfbe85f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,179,139,100,131,72,191,246,166,24,26,95,242,19,196,219,223,190,133,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
