It was based on the literary character Simon Templar, a suave and sophisticated Robin Hood-like adventurer and thief created by Leslie Charteris in the 1920s and featured in many novels and novellas over the years. He was played by Roger Moore.\n\nAs a result of the strong performance in the US of the first two black-and-white series in first-run syndication, NBC picked up the show as a summer replacement in its evening schedule in 1966. The programme therefore ended its run with both trans-Atlantic prime time scheduling and colour episodes. It also proved popular beyond the UK and US, eventually airing in over 60 countries, and made a profit in excess of Ã‚Â£350m for ITC.[2][3][4] With almost 120 episodes, the programme is exceeded only by The Avengers as the most productive show of its genre produced in the UK. As with The Avengers, the colour episodes were originally broadcast in the UK in black and white, predating the advent of colour transmissions on ITV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d909ae2a164cd7e17566b02b316b550794776fe4","amp;dn":"The+Saint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d909ae2a164cd7e17566b02b316b550794776fe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,9,174,42,22,76,215,225,117,102,176,43,49,107,85,7,148,119,111,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
