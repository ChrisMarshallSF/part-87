Jones hires his attorney, Patrick Henry (Macdonald Carey), to assist in business matters. He also takes a romantic interest in Henry's sweetheart, Dorothea Danders (Erin O'Brien).\nAfter serving as second-in-command of a man-of-war in the Bahamas, his adopted countrymen sign the American Declaration of Independence. Jones gets his first command, sets sail toward Newfoundland and seizes eighteen enemy ships, sending their supplies to American general George Washington (John Crawford).\nWashington sends the young officer to France, where he is appreciated for heroic feats at sea. Benjamin Franklin (Charles Coburn) then urges Jones to take a frigate and invade the British Isles. A new vessel is built for him at the suggestion of Marie Antoinette (Susana Canales), and the only condition of his majesty King Louis XVI (Jean-Pierre Aumont) is that Jones' ship fly under an American flag.\nJones' successes ultimately lead him to Russia in 1790 at the behest of the empress, Catherine the Great (Bette Davis).
