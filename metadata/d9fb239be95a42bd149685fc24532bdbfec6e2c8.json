In Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Goose GirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the queen sends her daughter away\nto her fate with a bloodied handkerchief tucked in her bosom, and in Ã¢â‚¬ËœSleeping BeautyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, MamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best efforts cannot\nprevent one little prick from having disastrous consequences for the heroine. Danielle WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mothers Grimm brings characters from these stories into the modern world in a collection of four long stories that interrogate contemporary\nwomanhood and motherhood. Happy endings not guaranteed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9fb239be95a42bd149685fc24532bdbfec6e2c8","amp;dn":"Mothers+Grimm+by+Danielle+Wood+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9fb239be95a42bd149685fc24532bdbfec6e2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,251,35,155,233,90,66,189,20,150,133,252,36,83,43,219,254,198,226,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
