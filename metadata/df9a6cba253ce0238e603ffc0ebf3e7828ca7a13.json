Ford had originally assembled this lineup to record his 1979 solo album The Inside Story which was released under the name of Robben Ford. During this initial period the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound combined elements of blues, jazz fusion, and progressive rock with Ford contributing vocals. Over the next year the group began moving in a more democratic direction, eliminating FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and embracing a more commercially oriented jazz-funk approach overall and the band signed with Warner Bros. as Yellowjackets.\n\nPerhaps the finest recording of this quartet's illustrious career, Dreamland captures the Yellowjackets at the peak of their compositional and performing craft. This band has moved far beyond its peers with this release. The music here is simply intoxicating, full of gorgeous melodies, deceptively intricate changes, subtle rhythmic and harmonic nuances, and flawless playing. Because of the consistency of the music, it is impossible to point out high spots. Bobby McFerrin has never sounded better than on his guest appearance on &quot;Summer Song,&quot; but it's the high level maintained by the four Yellowjackets throughout the disc that especially entrances the listener. This is a Dreamland where any connoisseur of quality music will find delight and quiet satisfaction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9a6cba253ce0238e603ffc0ebf3e7828ca7a13","amp;dn":"Yellowjackets+-+Dreamland+%281995%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9a6cba253ce0238e603ffc0ebf3e7828ca7a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,154,108,186,37,60,224,35,142,96,63,252,14,191,62,120,40,202,122,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
