Our hero Captain J.B. Coldyron, police robotics genius and ranch owner, whose dialogue was all dubbed by a different actor and written by a different species? The goofy office robot who somehow possesses more sophisticated intelligence than the dangerous Ã¢â‚¬Å“advancedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ prototype on the loose, aka R.O.T.O.R.? Or what the acronym R.O.T.O.R. itself stands for: Robotic Officer of the Tactical Operations Research. Yes, the last word in the killer police robotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name is Research, for some reason. Except later in the movie, when it suddenly stands for Reserve instead. Why? If you want an explanation, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better ask Shoeboogie, the wacky Native American janitor who loves to dance. Actually, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask Shoeboogie anything, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably best to avoid all eye contact with Shoeboogie.\n\nColdyron! Research! Shoeboogie! If you say those words real fast they kind of sound like a song, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also three of the many reasons you should join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for the wonder of wonders that is R.O.T.O.R.!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d5ae775c220bf4d1fee47aa58b5440b68d1a29","amp;dn":"ROTOR_highTV.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d5ae775c220bf4d1fee47aa58b5440b68d1a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,213,174,119,92,34,11,244,209,254,228,122,165,139,84,64,182,141,26,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
