This can capture media from cameras and most input sources for video AND audio.  It also means it can from TV tuner cards AND even your desktop.  Yes, it can capture media output from your viewing panel.  \n\nExamples of syntax:\nffmpeg -i input.mov -pix_fmt rgb565le -r 24 output.mp4\n(what does it do?)\nIt takes the file named &quot;input.mov&quot; and converts it to a color space format of 16 bit which is rrrrrggggggbbbbb with a rate of 24 frames/sec and outputs the data to a filename &quot;output.mp4&quot;\n\nffplay d:VIDEO_TSVTS_02_1.VOB\n(what does it do?)\nIt plays the file &quot;VTS_02_1.VOB&quot; from an actual DVD disk on drive d.\n\nffprobe c:UsersPublicVideos&quot;Sample Videos&quot;Bear.wmv\n(what does it do?)\nIt displays data from the file such as color space used, audio compression used, and commentary inside of the file.\n \nI recommend placing the files ffmpeg.exe ffprobe.exe and ffplay.exe in your system32 folder so they can be a part of the windows command list. \n\n&quot;Admiral Smith&quot; of United States of America.\nReviewed 09-29-2014\nDisclaimer:\nThe image [Admiral Smith - United States of America].jpg was a cute little clean furry image that I wanted to use as a commissioned stamp.  Each file that I review is comissioned in my database with a zero dollar value which means it is used for inventory purposes.  Why yes.  I may write off my storage bank off on my taxes.  I do not need to but that is what good commissioners do.  It is a new era of commissioners, custodians, and pickers.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOriginal Filename: ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.7z\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3a247ab75c378876c7aee1a673851d85ae1cea","amp;dn":"%5BAdmiral+Smith%5D+A3A6A2FFBD3F9A85-00003.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3a247ab75c378876c7aee1a673851d85ae1cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,58,36,122,183,92,55,136,118,199,174,225,166,115,133,29,133,174,28,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
