They run a truck off the road, and its driver staggers from the vehicle, falls, glows red and vanishes! Then the young couple suffocates - outside! It's all part of a scheme run by the alien Taugus, and it draws in David's brother Bob, Bob's wife Grace, and crusading newsman Theodore Booth. David has finally managed to convince both his brother and someone able to get the word out that he may be telling the truth about the alien invasion - but is it just in time to see the entire human population choking for air on their own planet?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebbea720d5da0807616f74b71ba839c3a6036a3f","amp;dn":"The+Invaders+Season+1+Ep.+16+-+Wall+Of+Crystal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebbea720d5da0807616f74b71ba839c3a6036a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,190,167,32,213,218,8,7,97,111,116,183,27,168,57,195,166,3,106,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
