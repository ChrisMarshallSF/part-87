Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56523e8876929cae2fc9952a4887673eb36fc97","amp;dn":"DDFBusty+Harmony+Reigns+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56523e8876929cae2fc9952a4887673eb36fc97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,101,35,232,135,105,41,202,226,252,153,82,164,136,118,115,235,54,252,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
