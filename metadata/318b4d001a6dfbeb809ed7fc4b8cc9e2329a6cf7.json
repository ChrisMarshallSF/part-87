The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises.              \n\nACTORS: \nWarwick Davis, Charlie Heath, Shevonne Durkin, Sandy Baron, Adam Biesk, James Lancaster, \n\nRELEASED: \n 8 April 1994 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 767097736 bytes (731.56 MiB), duration: 01:25:23, avg.bitrate: 1198 kb/s\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x404, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=19790925669018883713.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=19790925669018883713.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=43077431553370780268.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=43077431553370780268.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=32930993734122945193.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=32930993734122945193.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : MARS\n Movie Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318b4d001a6dfbeb809ed7fc4b8cc9e2329a6cf7","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+2+1994+iNTERNAL+BDRip+x264-MARS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318b4d001a6dfbeb809ed7fc4b8cc9e2329a6cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,139,77,0,26,109,251,235,128,158,215,252,75,140,201,226,50,154,108,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
