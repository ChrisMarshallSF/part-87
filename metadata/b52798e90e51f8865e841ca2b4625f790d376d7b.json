He then talks about the Bill Cosby rape allegations and the memeÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s that have popped up because of it, takes a few calls, and goes through MondayÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s mail. Ant talks about Jose Canseco being an idiot, the newest ISIS beheading, we hear an Ebola song, and watch a classic O&amp;A video. The show ends with a list of mysterious photos that cannot be explained, witnessing a sexy strip tease from Jesse Ventura, and by hearing a news story on &quot;Vacation breasts.&quot;\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52798e90e51f8865e841ca2b4625f790d376d7b","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-17+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52798e90e51f8865e841ca2b4625f790d376d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,39,152,233,14,81,248,134,94,132,28,162,180,98,95,121,13,55,109,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
