Those who became part of &quot;Mr. Lincoln's Army&quot; came from various social and economic conditions, and they documented their day-to-day life in diaries, letters and memoirs. Drawing on these narratives, contemporary photographs, and meticulous archival research, this book provides a vivid account of the common Union infantryman from recruitment and training to his experiences on the battlefield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a04b3054fe07dc5a6e70a27e2a3f8128d327aaf","amp;dn":"Union+Infantryman+1861-65","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a04b3054fe07dc5a6e70a27e2a3f8128d327aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,4,179,5,79,224,125,197,166,231,10,39,226,163,248,18,141,50,122,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
