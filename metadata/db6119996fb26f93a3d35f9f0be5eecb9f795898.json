That applies to the film scoring career of Hungarian-American composer MiklÃƒÂ³s RÃƒÂ³zsa, who was still active on an occasional basis in the mid-'70s, when this album of re-recorded excerpts from his work was released, although his prime period dated from the mid-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ30s to the early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s. Early on, especially in his work with Alexander Korda, RÃƒÂ³zsa seemed to have an affinity for fantasies set in exotic places, such as the Academy Award-nominated The Thief of Bagdad (1940). By 1944, when he got another Oscar nomination for Double Indemnity, he had become the go-to guy for film noir, leading to his first Academy Award for Spellbound (1945). Then, after he moved to MGM in the late Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ40s, his mÃƒÂ©tier became the historical epic with Quo Vadis (1951). Conductor Charles Gerhardt, leading his National Philharmonic Orchestra in cues drawn from a range of RÃƒÂ³zsa's scores, wisely mixes things up, giving a good sense of the composer's true range. The rousing adventure stuff is there in pieces from Knights of the Round Table and The Four Feathers, along with the darkly romantic themes of Spellbound, The Lost Weekend, and Double Indemnity, plus at least a little of the epics with Ivanhoe. Gerhardt may be a bit too enamored of The Red House (1947), devoting five tracks to it. But he manages to suggest the sweep of the composer's work over a long career just winding down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db6119996fb26f93a3d35f9f0be5eecb9f795898","amp;dn":"Spellbound+-+The+Classic+Film+Scores+of+Mikl%26oacute%3Bs+R%26oacute%3Bz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db6119996fb26f93a3d35f9f0be5eecb9f795898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,97,25,153,111,178,111,147,163,211,95,159,11,229,238,203,159,121,88,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
