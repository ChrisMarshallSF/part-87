In these uncertain times, former-Pinkerton-detective-turned-bestselling-author Jake Donovan is beckoned home to Manhattan. He has made good money as the creator of dashing gumshoe Blackie Doyle, but the price of success was Laura Wilson, the woman he left behind. Now a Broadway star, Laura is engaged to a millionaire bankerÃ¢â‚¬â€and waltzing into a dangerous trap.\n \nBefore Jake can win Laura back, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly killedÃ¢â‚¬â€and his former partner is shot deadÃ¢â‚¬â€after a visit to the Yankee Club, a speakeasy dive in their old Queens neighborhood. Suddenly Jake and Laura are plunged into a conspiracy that runs afoul of gangsters, sweeping from New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private clubs to the halls of corporate power and to the White House itself. Brushing shoulders with the likes of Dashiell Hammett, Cole Porter, and Babe Ruth, Jake struggles to expose an inconspicuous organization hidden in plain sight, one determined to undermine the president and change the country forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3667ac044a3d56710e3a45dff507071fe8963897","amp;dn":"The+Yankee+Club+by+Michael+Murphy+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3667ac044a3d56710e3a45dff507071fe8963897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,103,172,4,74,61,86,113,14,58,69,223,245,7,7,31,232,150,56,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
