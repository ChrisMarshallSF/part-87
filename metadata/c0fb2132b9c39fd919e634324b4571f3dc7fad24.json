Later in her life,She entered into the politics and was assassinated in 2001. \n\nSource-------- DVD5\nReleased------ 2014/10/27 @torrentgarden.com\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 1.57 GB\nLength-------- 1:54:48\nVideo Bit rate ~1800 KBps\nResolution---- 1024x576\nFrame rate---- 25 fps\nAudio--------- Hindi DD 2.0 @192 / English Commentary (aac) separate\nSubtitles----- Eng, Fin, Pol, Pob\nScreens------ &lt;a href=&quot; http://someimage.com/Q3hY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://someimage.com/Q3hY&lt;/a&gt; (DVD vs TG)\nEncoder------- HighCode\n\nTG torrents seeded 24x7 @ 1Gbps &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.ultraseedbox.com/aff.php?aff=270&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://www.ultraseedbox.com/aff.php?aff=270&lt;/a&gt;\nIf you can provide any HD, BD, Remux, BDRip, BRRip, Android/iphone, Bollywood &amp; Asian movies, Music, DvdRip, DvD, WebDl, TV Release please contact us.
