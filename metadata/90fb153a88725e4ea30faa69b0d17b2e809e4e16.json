The Home study course expands upon the earlier Code of the Natural ebook and &quot;downloadable&quot; videos. (This is not a dupe of the existing Rob Brinded - The Code of The Natural [Video - MP4]) This course includes expanded video footage, new exercises, more detail and a six week exercise plan.\n\nRob Brinded was an elite sports Trainer &amp; Strength and Conditioning coach for 15 years, the last 6 years with the Chelsea Football Club before starting his own company. Rob works with athletes in the areas of Rehabilitation, Posture and Sports Conditioning and has written several works on body language.\n\n\nTrigger attraction in her.. before you've even said a word. How To Permanently Change Your Body, Posture And Movement, On A Subconscious Level so that you spark magnetic attraction in red-hot women like a 'Natural'...\n\n&quot;This Is Pure Gold...&quot; - David DeAngelo\n\nNo matter what you look like, you will easily learn, step by step, to tap into the secret code of naturals to give off all the signals that women find irresistible... and change yourself into a confident, sexual man from the outside in... without having to think about itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nYou've been told so many times that body language is vital in attracting women but all you have read is to hold your shoulders back and try and stand tall... but deep down you know this doesn't really work. When they say it is important they are understating...IT IS HUGE!!! I have interviewed hundreds of women and they can tell almost everything about you within three seconds of seeing you move and stand. And if you have tension, poor posture and restricted movement...they will not even notice you.\n\nWorst still they will perceive you as either unconfident, unsexual and even CREEPY... and most guys don't even know they are doing this!!! Movement is not a choice and women are experts at seeing through your pickup lines and bravado and can quite literally read you like a book. However hard you try to walk cool or lean back... your movement will give you away.\n\nThis is incredibly frustrating as you want to meet women so badly... but you cannot simply think to change your movement and body. Most guys start going to the gym to build up their muscles... but it doesn't change the signals they give off... and lifting weights the popular gym way can even make your movement worse!!! I see countless musclebound guys in tight T-shirts parading in front of girls but their asymmetries and inner game issues show through loud and clear to women.\n\n\nMini Review: This is a great course for anyone who wants to improve their body language. The impact of body language and non-verbal communication are often under appreciated. Women do notice your body language on a subconscious level. This course clearly demonstrates and guides you in improving your own body language. I found it be highly effective and this course has received high marks from everyone that I have personally recommended it to. A highly recommended product","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90fb153a88725e4ea30faa69b0d17b2e809e4e16","amp;dn":"Rob+Brinded+-+Code+of+the+Natural+6+week+home+study+course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90fb153a88725e4ea30faa69b0d17b2e809e4e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,251,21,58,136,114,94,78,163,15,170,105,176,209,123,46,128,158,78,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
