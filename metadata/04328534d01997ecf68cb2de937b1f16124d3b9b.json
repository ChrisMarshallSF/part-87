Here's few more old+new Wii games. Some are pretty big, so I will leave further uploads until next week, and let these seed for a while.\n\nIf you don't like it, well, it was free, and you know where the delete button is! :-) \n\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii We Wish You A Merry Christmas [SMCPXT] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Christmas Mini Games\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (I have my uTorrent set to 1000%/10.0 !!) \nDo not just leech and run - help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help, please try to seed for as long as you can.\n\nIf you like it, maybe buy a Wii game that is not in my list, or here on TPB and upload it for the rest of us to have too - Thanks! :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 900+ Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/ow4n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/ow4n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search it and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all Wii games out there","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04328534d01997ecf68cb2de937b1f16124d3b9b","amp;dn":"Wii+We+Wish+You+A+Merry+Christmas+%5BSMCPXT%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04328534d01997ecf68cb2de937b1f16124d3b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,50,133,52,208,25,151,236,246,140,178,222,147,123,31,22,18,77,59,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
