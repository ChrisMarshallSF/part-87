Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under Ã¢â‚¬Å“Settings / Advanced settingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in iOS 7.\nThe maps are part of the application, no roaming fees: no need for cellular network coverage, no surprises. (Some Services Ã¢â‚¬â€œ e.g. Live Traffic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ require mobile Internet connection. Your operator may charge you for the data used and costs may be significantly higher when used abroad. To avoid unwanted roaming costs being generated abroad by the Live Traffic Service or other services requiring Internet connection (where applicable), please carefully review your settings in the Config Wizard or turn off Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Data RoamingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on your device.)\n\nMap updates are subject to availability and may come as part of software updates.
