Though Zabuza sees Haku as nothing more than a tool, he is moved by NarutoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words as he tearfully acknowledges HakuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacrifice. With Kakashi telling Naruto not to interfere out of respect, Zabuza is allowed to redeem himself as a ninja. With only a kunai in his mouth, enduring multiple stabs and beatings, Zabuza manages to break through GatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men and kills the crime lord before collapsing as GatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces retreat when villagers arrive. Soon after, Team 7 are relieved to discover that Sasuke is still alive as the senbon were laced with a sleeping drug. Honoring ZabuzaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dying wish to place him by Haku, Kakashi assures his former enemy that he and Haku will go to the same place. Soon after he and Team 7 give the two rouge ninjas a burial with ZabuzaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s KubikiribÃ…ï¿½chÃ…ï¿½ as a grave marker, Naruto express his distain for the notion that ninjas should strive to become merely tools and declares that he will find his own Ninja Way. As Team 7 leave for the Hidden Leaf, Tazuna proclaims to the village that the bridge will be called the Great Naruto Bridge to signify the strength that Naruto gave Inari, who in turn gave to the whole town","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4173dec66d8697f3495f150468fba19e2e04c443","amp;dn":"Naruto+Episode+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4173dec66d8697f3495f150468fba19e2e04c443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,115,222,198,109,134,151,243,73,95,21,4,104,251,161,158,46,4,196,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
