And a SPEK sample image to show the final spectrum of the WAV file (I didnt put the M4A spectrum image because of the little difference).\n\nÃ‚Â·You can check and comment, of course.\n\nÃ‚Â·Also i putted the gain of the FLAC versiÃƒÂ³n +0.5 db to equal the MP3 level, but that didnt distort anything as the FLAC versiÃƒÂ³n was less higher.\n\nÃ‚Â·Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9c2e46c3d6a177fe380f43cd1ca00b52c2b388","amp;dn":"Some+Chords+%28Dillon+Francis+Remix%29+%5BOriginal+F%2A%2Ak+sample%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9c2e46c3d6a177fe380f43cd1ca00b52c2b388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,156,46,70,195,214,161,119,254,56,15,67,205,28,160,11,82,194,179,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
