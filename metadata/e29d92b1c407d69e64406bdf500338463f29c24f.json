Boxing legend Larry Holmes joins Ant to chat about gambling, his boxing career, his toughest competitors, and his thoughts on UFC. Larry waxes on his relationship with Don King, what he thinks of the millions George Foreman is making off of his silly grill, tells us about his show Ã¢â‚¬Å“What the Heck Were They Thinking?,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and touches a bit on race relations. Larry then discusses the love he has for his fans, the money sports stars are making these days, and injuries boxers get and how it affects them. Larry shares a throwback story about Mike Tyson, talks about his relationship with Tyson now, tells us about his son Larry Jr., his bond with Gerry Cooney, the example that sports figures can and do set for kids, and talks a little shit about his poker playing skills before he leaves. We end the broadcast with Ant receiving a few gifts from a fan and hearing about the bounties on TACS crew as well as Larry Holmes for the poker tournament tonight. \n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29d92b1c407d69e64406bdf500338463f29c24f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-12-05+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29d92b1c407d69e64406bdf500338463f29c24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,157,146,177,196,7,214,158,100,64,107,223,80,3,56,70,63,41,194,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
