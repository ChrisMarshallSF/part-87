I love this movie for what it is &amp; after searching &amp; waiting for way too long to obtain it again, I wanted to make sure anyone else that wanted to see it would be able to do so without having to dig so deep. This is Yahoo Serious' latest film &amp; it is just loaded with all sorts of physical comedy &amp; it even has a good message at the heart of it's plot, I think everyone should watch it at least once. I hope you enjoy. Thank You. =)\n\n\nLength: 01:25:34\nResolution: 512x368\nData rate: 1015kbps\nTotal bitrate:1143kbps\nFrame rate: 25f/ps\nAudio bit rate: 128kbps\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 48kHz\n\nIMDB:\n\nA very clumsy man and his UFO-obsessed girlfriend discover a plan made by his boss to market eggs laced with nicotine.\n\nDirector: Yahoo Serious\nWriters: David Roach, Yahoo Serious\nStars: Yahoo Serious, Helen Dallimore, David Field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:144306ffb86e866e3d00e562cacea4e38c7746d3","amp;dn":"Mr.+Accident+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"144306ffb86e866e3d00e562cacea4e38c7746d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,67,6,255,184,110,134,110,61,0,229,98,202,206,164,227,140,119,70,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
