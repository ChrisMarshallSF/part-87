But I've got a free night so I'm going to upload a few episodes. I've capped almost all of them so don't worry they'll be up eventually. (I did miss an episode on the 14th I think it was. DVR failure.) Anyway keep an eye out 'cause they're still coming.\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE INDEPENDENTS (written by Matt Welch, taken from Reason)\n---------------------------\nTonight's live episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three hours later) will include a trademark mix of talk about scary subjects, mixed with deep skepticism about same (particularly of government reaction toward them).\n\nThe conversation starts with Kobani, the Syrian Kurdish border town that has been on the verge of Islamic State takeover for the last 30 hours, though increased U.S. bombing has reportedly stopped the ISIS surge. Joining to discuss are Party Panelists Will Rahn (Daily Beast senior editor) and Joe DeVito (comedian), who will also tackle Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's latest American Enterprise Institute-pleasing call for pinning military spending to 4% of GDP (hey, it worked for Mitt Romney, amirite?), and also the controversy over Jennifer Lawrence's recent Vanity Fair cover and quote about her hacked nudie photos being a &quot;sex crime.&quot;\n\nCato Institute Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies Christopher Preble (read his Reason archive here), will argue just how wrong Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey has been when repeatedly insisting that we are living in the most &quot;dangerous&quot; era of recent times. Dr. Eugene Seymour of the nanomedicine company NanoViricides, will report on the latest medical developments in the fight against Ebola. Foundation for Individual Rights in Education President Greg Lukianoff will talk about his new mini-book, Freedom From Speech. And Kmele Foster will detail the latest sadly predictable news about the Georgia cops who will not face criminal charges after flash-grenading off part of a 19-month-old's face.\n\n\nINFO\n----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pass on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : The.Independents.2014.10.07.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 352 MiB \nDuration : 42mn 20s \nOverall bit rate : 1 162 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3c74555b547c700f120c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 42mn 20s \nBit rate : 1 023 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 14.985 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.117 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1023 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 42mn 20s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 38.8 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9b1a97945ff72f5a67180123b4e8c6b97f0cf2","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.10.07.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9b1a97945ff72f5a67180123b4e8c6b97f0cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,155,26,151,148,95,247,47,90,103,24,1,35,180,232,198,185,127,12,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
