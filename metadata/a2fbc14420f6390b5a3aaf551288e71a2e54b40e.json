For much of the film the audience is treated to scenes of freshly-married bliss. The couple have parked their car/camper combination in a remote area, and generally frolic around. Then they begin to experience some odd occurrences, such as one of their two hamsters killing the other one. When hubby discovers a nearby home where he can get water, the story gets much more complicated and involves a blind woman, a murderer, and some inexplicable symbolism.\n\nVideo info: 720x540 - 25fps - 1h 26mn 22s 640ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2fbc14420f6390b5a3aaf551288e71a2e54b40e","amp;dn":"Morbo+%28+Morbidness+%29+%5B1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2fbc14420f6390b5a3aaf551288e71a2e54b40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,251,193,68,32,246,57,11,90,58,175,85,18,136,231,26,46,84,180,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
