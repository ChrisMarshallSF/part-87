For almost 20 years, a group of extraterrestrials contacted hundreds of people with a number of strange requests. The project was called &quot;Friendship.&quot; The people involved were taken on board multiple UFOs and also shown alien bases on earth. These people are of high social and cultural importance. Among them, the Italian diplomat Alberto Perego. The witnesses of this incredible alien contact are finally willing to speak. This documentary changes past assumptions of why interaction between humans and extraterrestrial civilizations exist. Includes stunning photos and film footage of alien spacecraft in flight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:123cd13fd25bd84f5874d64da4cbbd129a0dab6d","amp;dn":"The+Friendship+Case+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"123cd13fd25bd84f5874d64da4cbbd129a0dab6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,60,209,63,210,91,216,79,88,116,214,77,164,203,189,18,154,13,171,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
