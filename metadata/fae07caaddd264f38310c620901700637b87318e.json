Just like photoshop.\n------------------------------\n\nThis is my 3ÃŠÂ³Ã¡ÂµË† release of this film. Why a new release? The answer isn't so much to do with improved quality or anything, although the quality might be slightly better than the last one, but not by much. The reason I'm re-releasing this is because since the last time I uploaded a version of this film I have learned how to deinterlace an MP2 file completely manually. That is, no &quot;magic tricks&quot; were involved in the creation of this video from its MP2 source files which reside in the VIDEO_TS subfolder found in every DVD [even BluRay I think!].\n\nPreviously I had written the following:\n\n[HISTORY (abridged version)]\n\nWhat this avi in fact is, is a near-duplicate/deinterlaced version of the reconstruction/re-release of Tony Palmer's extraordinary (ha!) documentary about Leonard Cohen's 1972 European tour, one or the other of which (tour or documentary) is or was, and this sentence is already WAY TOO LONG so I won't look it up, entitled &quot;Bird On A Wire&quot;.\n\n[snip]\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and there this thing sits, my so-called &quot;perfect offering&quot; marred horrendously with what started to look like dark crayon lines. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n[/HISTORY]\n\nWhat the dark crayon lines were, if you haven't guessed, were &quot;scan line&quot; artifacts due to the interlaced data format found in every DVD [definitely including BluRay and anything else to follow forever and ever and ever].\n\nWhat I did was stop the encoding, add a deinterlace &quot;filter&quot; to the encoding scheme and run it again. I knew this would cause the result to be slightly out of focus compared with what it would look like if rendered properly (interlaced) but it would be far better than having those lines.\n\nI have outlined the discoveries I made elsewhere and won't bore you with how to do it. Suffice it to say that I have done better than the automatic deinterlacing filter(s) and occasionally worse (but one can always retry). The case where I did better was so outstanding (in my mind) that I believed I'd solved the problem completely. That's not entirely true since my last attempt (Leonard Cohen in London), although acceptable, was definitely slightly less clear than what I got with the automatic filter. So I will retry that one until I get it exactly right.\n\nThe tools I used to deinterlace an entire DVD and convert it to an progressive AVI file were the following:\n\n1. cmd.exe\n2. VirtualDub.exe\n    i. MPEG2.vdplugin [for VirtualDub]\n3. xvidfw.dll\n\nIn case you're curious, the video that I deinterlaced and came out with a near perfect result is called &quot;EsbjÃƒÂ¶rn Svensson Trio Berghousen Germany 2001 XviD AC3 720p&quot; or or something similar to that. The clarity of that video is, on my machine, as good as the perfect video sources that exist for the Jools Holland program in 2014 (see user BasilBrush). And to my knowledge there are no videos more perfect than those. The result here is not as good as that, naturally, because the source is from 1972 when they didn't have &quot;High Definition&quot; (they didn't have it in 2001 either, but remember those were Germans who filmed that).
