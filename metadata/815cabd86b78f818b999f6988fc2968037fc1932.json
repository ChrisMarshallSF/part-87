In movies the role of editing adds something unique: the opportunity to extend and/or expand a visual (or narrative) idea to the limits of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imaginationÃ¢â‚¬â€a crazy idea that works today is tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s normal.\n\nI value the ability to stage something well because when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done well its pleasures are huge, and most people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it well, which indicates it must not be easy to master (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frightening how many opportunities there are to do something wrong in a sequence or a group of scenes. Minefields EVERYWHERE. Fincher said it: thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potentially a hundred different ways to shoot something but at the end of the day thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really only two, and one of them is wrong). Of course understanding story, character, and performance are crucial to directing well, but I operate under the theory a movie should work with the sound off, and under that theory, staging becomes paramount (the adjective, not the studio. although their logo DOES appear on the front of thisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦).\n\nSo I want you to watch this movie and think only about staging, how the shots are built and laid out, what the rules of movement are, what the cutting patterns are. See if you can reproduce the thought process that resulted in these choices by asking yourself: why was each shotÃ¢â‚¬â€whether short or longÃ¢â‚¬â€held for that exact length of time and placed in that order? Sounds like fun, right? It actually is. To me. Oh, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve removed all sound and color from the film, apart from a score designed to aid you in your quest to just study the visual staging aspect. Wait, WHAT? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? Well, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not saying IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m like, ALLOWED to do this, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying this is what I do when I try to learn about staging, and this filmmaker forgot more about staging by the time he made his first feature than I know to this day (for example, no matter how fast the cuts come, you always know exactly where you areÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high level visual math shit).\n\nAt some point you will say to yourself or someone THIS LOOKS AMAZING IN BLACK AND WHITE and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because Douglas Slocombe shot THE LAVENDER HILL MOB and the THE SERVANT and his stark, high-contrast lighting style was eye-popping regardless of medium","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815cabd86b78f818b999f6988fc2968037fc1932","amp;dn":"Raiders+of+the+Lost+Ark+%281981%29+-+soderbergh+edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815cabd86b78f818b999f6988fc2968037fc1932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,92,171,216,107,120,248,24,185,153,246,152,143,194,150,128,55,252,25,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
