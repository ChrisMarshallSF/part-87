Although this legendary love triangle has been studied exhaustively, JeanetteÃ¢â‚¬â€herself a gifted pianistÃ¢â‚¬â€wonders about the enduring nature of Clara and Johannes's lifelong attachment. Were they just &quot;best friends,&quot; as both steadfastly claimed? Or was the relationship complicated by desires that may or may not have been consummated?\n\nThrough a chance encounter, Jeanette meets Hart, a mysterious, worldly entrepreneur who is a native of Clara's birthplace, Leipzig, Germany. Hart's casual help with translations quickly blossoms into something more. There are things about men and women, he insists, that do not change. The two embark on a whirlwind emotional journey that leads Jeanette across Germany and Switzerland to a crossroads similar to that faced by Clara SchumannÃ¢â‚¬â€also a mother, also an artistÃ¢â‚¬â€more than a century earlier.\n\nAccompanied by photographs, sketches, and notes from past and present, A. Manette Ansay's original blend of fiction and history captures the timeless nature of love and friendship between women and men","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a267b7ef564ceab8dcdbb421f1767947791f39d","amp;dn":"Good+Things+I+Wish+You+by+A.+Mantte+Ansay+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a267b7ef564ceab8dcdbb421f1767947791f39d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,38,123,126,245,100,206,171,141,205,187,66,31,23,103,148,119,145,243,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
