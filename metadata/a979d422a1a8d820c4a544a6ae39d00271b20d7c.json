Image size reduced to 293 MB. \n\n 2. Latest versions of Flash, Thunderbird and Chrome extensions. \n\n 3. New default wallpaper &amp; custom Conky display. \n\n 4. New toggle switch on JWM Desktop menu to turn Conky display on and off. \n\n 5. Expanded README notes with original launcher on Metro tile and additional bookmark in browser. \n\n 6. For V6 there now remains only one optional- BlueScreenSaver.pet. All other service packs and previously optional pets having been incorporated. \n\n 7. On the new desktop the Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ appears. It seemed to fit in with the new wallpaper but is also an additional icon to launch the Metro interface. In a similar fashion to the WWW panel icon it will not launch it full screen. \n To launch Metro full screen, press the left hand Windows key or kiss the left hand side of your screen with your mouse pointer if you have Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hot Screen SidesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ enabled. \n\n 8. A change from Chromium to Chrome Stable 38.0.2125.101 proved problematic. I will await the next stable version but have upgraded libnss3 to 3.17.1 in anticipation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a979d422a1a8d820c4a544a6ae39d00271b20d7c","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_blue_pup.V6.archive.13-Oct-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a979d422a1a8d820c4a544a6ae39d00271b20d7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,121,212,34,161,168,216,32,196,165,68,166,174,57,208,2,113,178,13,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
