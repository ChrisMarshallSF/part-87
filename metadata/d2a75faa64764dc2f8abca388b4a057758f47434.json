Influenced by the ever growing death metal scene, they soon created the name Malamor (from latin root words Malus Amor) which means &quot;To love all that is evil&quot;. They felt that by making their music brutal, but also catchy, they could capture the attention of the audience and keep them moving.\n\nMalamor recorded a five song demo in May of 1995 at a twenty four track studio in Bearsville, NY called &quot;Applehead&quot;. Originally only meant for clubsMalamor, this 1995 demo entitled &quot;Condemn The Rising&quot; became widely sought after by fans of the local death metal scene. In early 1997, &quot;Condemn The Rising&quot; was released through &quot;Sherlocks Upstate Records&quot; and sold out of the first 500 tapes in only a few months. Malamor re-ordered more and has been selling copies ever since. Multiple songs on this demo have appeared on various underground CD and cassette compilations.\n\nSince playing their first show at a local schoolMalamor, Malamor has performed hundreds of times all over the World. They have been fortunate enough to open for just about every national Death Metal band that tours including Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Fear Factory, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, Malevolent Creation, Suffocation, Immolation and many others.\n\nMalamor released their full length CD &quot;Dead To The World&quot;, featuring guest backup vocals by Frank Mullen of Suffocation in May of 2004 through Amputated Vein Records. Directly after this, Malamor toured with Suffocation and Dying Fetus throughout the US and Canada and later that year headlined 3 shows in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n\n\nReview from http://www.globaldomination.se/\n\nQuote:\nNew York style death metal gets a lot of shit for being slammy, chuggy, and derivative. We all know who started the style, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all pretty tired of hearing endless clones attempt to replicate their sound. The clones have succeeded only in driving the subgenre right into a brick wall. Or right off a peak in the Catskills. Right onto that sleeping Rip Van Winkle fuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head. Fuck that legendary motherfucker. Drink a cup of coffee already.\n\nAnywayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever been past the Bronx and into what we city-centric folks call Ã¢â‚¬Å“upstate,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some cool stuff and some shitty stuff to see. Lots of wilderness, some mountains, some shitty suburbs, some rusted machinery half-covered under tarps in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front lawns, even some hippies/rednecks. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m guessing that the members of Malamor (to love all that is evil, including Knievel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ gay) are drawn from the latter category. Some dudes who got tired of just listening to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pierced from withinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while they worked on beaten up Camaros and decided theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give death metal a shot.\n\nWell, despite their honorable intentions it sounds like they have nowhere near the skills required to emulate their mentors. Instrumentally, lyrically, mentally. It took them FIVE FUKKIN YEARS to write amazing words like these from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fuckers like youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½:\n\nCriticize, those who know\nYou piece of shit\nWhy donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you, get fucked!\n\nMalamor should have gotten in touch with Spartacus to help Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem with the lyrics. Get that man a plane ticket, a leather shirt, and some blastbeats and he would have whipped the whole crew into shape. As you can see, there seems to be a strong hardcore element to the proceedings, with an hxcx flavor concerned with respect and kicking ass and PUNISHMENT for all our sins. The breakdowns sound tuff as well.\n\nEnough criticism. These guys do have some groove. And the vocals are competent. The disc isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t painful to listen to, just monotonous. AndÃ¢â‚¬Â¦uhÃ¢â‚¬Â¦IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m done. After somehow touring with a million US death metal bands and headlining a few shows in Japan (where old bands go to die) these dudes are painstakingly putting together another album. I wish them the best of luck in breaking free from the chains of obvious influences and mediocrity. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mal-amore!\n\nWorst of all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frank Ã¢â‚¬Å“HandshakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mullen does guest vocals on the opening track. Why encourage this type of behavior Frank? WHY?\n\n3 New Yorkments out of 10 .\n\nMembers\nDrew Kerwin - Bass\nGavin Parsons - Drums\nBen Kolts - Guitar, Vocals\nJason Kolts - Vocals\n\n\nTrack listing\n01. Dead To The World\n02.
