Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nOn tonight's Kennedy Watch: Trump continues to solidify his lead, Carson surges, Jeb Bush sagging in the polls, Hillary bleeding in the polls while Bernie Sanders gains.\n\nWe've got an all-star panel tonight. MATT WELCH, MICHAEL MALICE, and BEN KISSEL are here to talk about the Trump factor. Trump continues to lead in the polls - even the establishment is being forced to come around.. or are they? Next up, Bernie Sanders is 10 points ahead of Hillary in Iowa and 22 points ahead in New Hampshire. (!!) \n\nJoe Biden is mulling over a presidential bid. Is he the Democrats plan B? Kennedy hits the streets to ask who should take over if Hillary Clinton falls. No one says Biden. Our panel discusses.\n\nBRIAN BRENBERG is here to talk about his college report card. He's not a student. He's actually grading colleges themselves. High marks for a good education, cheap price, and actually getting a job in the field you're going to school for.\n\nThe panel returns to talk Arnold Schwarzenegger taking over Celebrity Apprentice. Trump doesn't mind. Afterwards they're talking about SUNY's new diversity policy &amp; the 7 options a recent college questionnaire had in regards to sexual identity.\n\nCould Alzheimer possibly be contagious under certain conditions? DR. TRAVIS STORK (doctor) is here to tell you, &quot;No.&quot; Then they move on to talking about if a computer could predict when someone is going to die. Guess what the answer is?\n\nNightcap: Kennedy talks songs used at campaign rallies, suggests some new ones.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.09.14.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 2s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 163 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 2s\nBit rate                                 : 1 024 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 7.493 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.156\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1024 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 2s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5122132b13bd5dcbf4126d7af4941b59a1946b5","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.09.14.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5122132b13bd5dcbf4126d7af4941b59a1946b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,18,33,50,177,59,213,220,191,65,38,215,175,73,65,181,154,25,70,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
