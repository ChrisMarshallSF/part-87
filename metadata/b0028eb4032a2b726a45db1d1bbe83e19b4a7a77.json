He truly captures the plight, the soul, and the hard working spirit of the Jewish tech. Bailey Alexander truly shines in this film, and it's no wonder they won best picture at sundance four times in a row. Bailey Alexander's co-stars are shining stars of their own, but they fail to shine as bright as Bailey. Caleb Lundquist, Zach Warren, and Josh Weir fail to live up to the bar set by the Jewish Bailey Alexander. Bailey is Love. Bailey is Life. The Jews will rise again.\n\nPrequel to the film Bustie Alexander: Stronger, Faster, FATTER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0028eb4032a2b726a45db1d1bbe83e19b4a7a77","amp;dn":"Bailey+Alexander%3A+The+Life+of+a+Jewish+Tech","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0028eb4032a2b726a45db1d1bbe83e19b4a7a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,2,142,180,3,42,43,114,106,69,219,29,27,190,131,225,155,74,122,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
