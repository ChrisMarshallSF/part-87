Fripp later soloed on top of this. No Pussyfooting represents the duo's initial experiments with this system, a side each.\n\n&quot;Heavenly Music Corporation&quot; demonstrates the beauty of the setup, with several guitar and synth elements building on top of each other, the music slowly evolving, and Fripp ending the piece with low dive-bombing feedback that swoops over the soundscape, bringing the piece to its conclusion. &quot;Swastika Girls,&quot; on the other hand, shows how the system can be abused. With too many disconnected sounds sharing the space, some discordant, some melodic, the resulting work lacks form and structure. Eno and Fripp later refined the system on Evening Star and Eno's solo album Discreet Music. Fripp would take the system and base whole albums and live appearances around it (particularly Let the Power Fall). But it was here on No Pussyfooting where it all started. [Discipline's 2008 reissue included a bonus disc featuring half-speed and reversed versions of both compositions.]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - The Heavenly Music Corporation\n02 - The Heavenly Music Corporation\n03 - The Heavenly Music Corporation\n04 - The Heavenly Music Corporation\n05 - The Heavenly Music Corporation\n06 - Swastika Girls\n07 - Swastika Girls\n08 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (reversed)\n09 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (reversed)\n10 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (reversed)\n11 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (reversed)\n12 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (reversed)\n\nCD2\n01 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (half speed)\n02 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (half speed)\n03 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (half speed)\n04 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (half speed)\n05 - The Heavenly Music Corporation (half speed)\n06 - Swastika Girls (reversed)\n07 - Swastika Girls (reversed)\n\n*2008 Opal / Discipline Global Mobile / RF | DGM5007\n\n\nPersonnel:\nRobert Fripp / Gibson Les Paul electric guitar\nBrian Eno / Tape delay system, VCS3 synthesizer, sequencer\n\n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Robert Fripp - Damage (1994) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11565521/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_Damage_%281994%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11565521/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_Damage_%281994%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDavid Sylvian &amp; Robert Fripp - The First Day (1993) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11543323/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_The_First_Day_%281993%29_%5BEAC-FLA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11543323/David_Sylvian__amp__Robert_Fripp_-_The_First_Day_%281993%29_%5BEAC-FLA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
