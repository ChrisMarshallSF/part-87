Former GOP congressman and longshot presidential candidate Thaddeus McCotter breaks down how the governing breakdown in Congress is worrisome even for those of us who don't want the bastidges to get things done.\n\nThere have been few governmental foul-ups in this dreary young century more infuriatingly inept than those in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. So yes, we have former Federal Emergency Management Agency head Michael Brown on to talk about how FEMA went bad, what it's like being the scapegoat, and whether the original sin in disaster-relief is federalizing the stuff in the first place.\n\nReason readers (and viewers) know all about O.G. NSA whistleblower William Binney; Fox Business Network viewers will also get a taste of the man who was punished for warning his superiors that the agency was shredding the Constitution. Speaking of punished whistleblowers, have you heard of the V.A.'s Scott Davis? Well, you will tonight, including detail of how the White House itself allegedly intervened to punish bad news at the source. And we all know the Post Office sucks, but what happens when you try to compete with the monopoly? Outbox co-founder Evan Baehr will explain how a great idea got snuffed.\n\nThis is such a good show, it hurts my feelings. I dare you not only to watch it, but encourage your frenemies to do the same. It really is that swell.\n\n\nINFO\n----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pass on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : The.Independents.2014.10.10.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.avi \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 352 MiB \nDuration : 42mn 21s \nOverall bit rate : 1 162 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eba3828c83aba7d8c5db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 42mn 21s \nBit rate : 1 023 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.117 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1023 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 42mn 21s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 38.8 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0511163e7ad1b307e3a1fb5f6878ac782d98ebd","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.10.10.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0511163e7ad1b307e3a1fb5f6878ac782d98ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,81,17,99,231,173,27,48,126,58,31,181,246,135,138,199,130,217,142,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
