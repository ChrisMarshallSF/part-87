ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his way of life, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prepare to defend it at any cost, along with his pal LÃƒÂ¡zaro, as lazy as Juan but twice as dumb. JuanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only emotional tie is his daughter, Camila, a beautiful young girl that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want anything to do with her father because the only thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good at is getting into trouble.\n\nSuddenly some strange things start to happen, people are turning violent attacking one to the other. Juan was first convinced itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just another stage of the Revolution. Official media refer to the attacks as isolated incidents provoked by Cuban dissidents paid by the US government. Little by little Juan and his friends start to realize that the attackers are not normal human beings and that killing them is quite a difficult task. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not vampires, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not possesed, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re definitely not dissidents; a simple bite turns the victim into other violent killing machine and the only way to beat them is destroying their brains.\nJuan decides that the best way of facing the situation is making some money out of itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Juan of the Dead, we kill your beloved onesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ becomes his slogan.

The population is helpless. There comes a moment in which the only way out people found is throwing into the sea and try to run away from an island that became a real carnage, and Juan has no choice but to do what he avoided all his life: take some responsibility assuming a hero role, to guide his beloved ones with the hope of getting them safe out of the madness in which Havana, full of flesh eating zombies has turned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b170a539ea8c49b9b5684f7832079ecc032e28f","amp;dn":"Juan+Of+The+Dead+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b170a539ea8c49b9b5684f7832079ecc032e28f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,23,10,83,158,168,196,155,155,86,132,247,131,32,121,236,192,50,226,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
