Since I've not seen this show on Dime, and folks claim that this is THE DEFINITIVE COPY, I thought I'd post it. Instead of posting a CD copy of the tape that I had, I borrowed the tape from the person I got my copy from. I'm glad I did, as his tape turned out to be a very old Maxell Metal particle tape, which is the way he rec'd it from a Zep trader at least 20 years ago.\n \nI've heard of several different boot LP's that have been made of this show, and this is  supposedly not from any of those. The recording is so clean and sharp that you can really hear every minute thing that happens on stage,,,,,comments that Ozzy makes under his breath, guitars being plugged and unplugged, every little thing, very loud and clear. Some pops audible between songs have been debated as being LP surface noise, but with constant plugging and unplugging going on between songs, I don't think that's the case. The main things that convince me that this is an actual source tape are the lack of cuts which would be indicative of a boot LP of this length(at least four sides of wax), and the inclusion of ALL of the between song dialogue INCLUDING almost 2 solid minutes between the main set and the encore of nonstop soundboard audience noise through the on-stage mics. None of that is common in the boot LP world. Even though the opening intro is missing, this is also the longest, most complete unedited version.... from what I've been told.\n\nI am not a Sabbath collector by any means, so if anything here is not accurate, let me know.\nI do believe, however, that this is VERY possibly the best version available of this amazing show! \n\nWhere is the TV footage????\n\nOZZY - VOCALS\nTONY IOMMI - GUITAR\nBILL WARD - DRUMS\nGEEZER BUTLER - BASS\n\n01.TOMOROW'S DREAM\n02.SWEET LEAF\n03.KILLING YOUR SELF TO LIVE\n04.WAR PIGS\n05.SNOWBLIND\n06.SABBRA CADABRA(BEGINS)\n07.TONY SOLO\n08 BILL SOLO 1\n09.BILL SOLO 2\n10.SUPERNAUT\n11.IRON MAN\n12.
