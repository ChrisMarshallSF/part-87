It was released on October 4, 2005 through Octone Records. A re-packaged CD/DVD special edition was released on October 30, 2007, which included additional acoustic tracks and music videos. The album was re-released on January 14, 2008 through Polydor Records in the United Kingdom, which included three additional acoustic tracks.  Musically, Flyleaf is a Christian alternative rock and hard rock album with heavy influences of nu-metal, emo and heavy metal. While the band's frontwoman Lacey Sturm prominently sings, her unclean vocals are a frequent throughout the album. Lyrically, the album deals with topics such as Christianity, love and death. Flyleaf received mixed reviews from music critics, who commended its &quot;radio-friendly&quot; yet hardcore sound, but criticized its use of formula. It debuted at No. 88 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 13,000 copies within its first week. Due to the band's growing exposure to fame in 2007, it eventually reached its peak of No. 57 on the week of September 17, 2007, and spent more than 133 weeks on the chart. It also topped the Billboard Christian Albums chart, and has since become the ninth best-selling Christian album of the 2000s. It has sold more than 1 million copies to date, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] I'm So Sick\n[02] Fully Alive\n[03] Perfect\n[04] Cassie\n[05] Sorrow\n[06] I'm Sorry\n[07] All Around Me\n[08] Red Sam\n[09] There For You\n[10] Breathe Today\n[11] So I Thought\n[12] Fully Alive [Acoustic]\n[13] All Around Me [Acoustic]\n[14] Cassie [Acoustic]\n\nPlay Time - 00h:42m:21s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 315mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
