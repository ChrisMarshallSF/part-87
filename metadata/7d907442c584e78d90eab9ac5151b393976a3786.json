It is only missing six. These are all mastered by Steve Hoffman. The last pack will contain the artwork and a few of the CD's. The 10 cc Album is an unreleased one. However it is known that at least a few hundred came out that were just in the jewel case without any artwork. I believe the one here is from one of those and because it had no artwork I have just used the disc image as the artwork.\n\nHere is a list of the ones missing and I hope that someone will be able to upload these to complete the collection for all.\n\nGZS 1102\tBill Evans Trio\t\tInterplay\n\nGZS 1104\tNat King Cole\t\tLove is the thing\n\nGZS 1130\tJudy Collins\t\tColors of the day /best of\n\nGZS 1135-2\tJudy Garland\t\tJudy at Carnegie Hall\n\nGZS 1141\tEverly Brothers\t\tBest of\n\nARZ 104-2\tSinatra\t\t\tRobin and the 7 Hoods\n\n\nPlease seed!
