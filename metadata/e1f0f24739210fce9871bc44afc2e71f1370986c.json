Long out of print on vinyl, still unavailable on CD in the early 21st century and widely bootlegged similar to the original &quot;Missing 6&quot;, the album is considered to be the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of all Neil Young albums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f0f24739210fce9871bc44afc2e71f1370986c","amp;dn":"neil+young-time+fades+away-CANADA-1973-reprise-MS2151-24K+ALAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f0f24739210fce9871bc44afc2e71f1370986c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,240,242,71,57,33,15,206,152,113,188,68,175,194,231,31,19,112,152,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
