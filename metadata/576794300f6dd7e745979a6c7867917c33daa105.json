What they do find is a cylinder made of some strange metal they can't identify. They have it sent to Sperrick Laboratories. It arrives, but not without incident. Someone tried to hijack the mail truck, and two security guards were killed. David Vincent arrives at Sperrick to investigate. He is certain that the aliens were behind the attempted hijacking and that what they wanted was that strange cylinder. He is also certain that they will try again. Vincent finds allies in a security guard and a woman scientist. But as always, he never knows which of his friends are real and which are enemies in disguise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576794300f6dd7e745979a6c7867917c33daa105","amp;dn":"The+Invaders+Season+1+Ep.+9+-+Quantity%3A+Unknown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576794300f6dd7e745979a6c7867917c33daa105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,103,148,48,15,109,215,231,69,151,154,108,120,103,145,124,51,218,161,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
