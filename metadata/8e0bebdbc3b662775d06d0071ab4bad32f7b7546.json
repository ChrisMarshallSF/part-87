I put this on the left to get them in\n   chronological order; can be used to construct the upload page URL directly.\n\n   Second snippet:    Date per torrent name. Ordinary dates mean Weeklies, while the\n   ones with a 00 in the day/month position are Monthlies/Annuals, respectively.\n\n   Third snippet:     Type of torrent. In order, 0D(ay) or H(it)L(ist), part number,\n   and revision (1 for regulars, 2 for &quot;fixes&quot;, &quot;repacks&quot;, &quot;fillers&quot;, et cetera).\n\n   Fourth snippet:    Initial letters of first and last files contained. Note that\n   this is meaningless in the rare cases in which torrents were not alphabetized.\n\nNOTE: Any mistakes made in the original titles are (deliberately) preserved here, so trust the first and last tokens rather than the ones in-between, whenever in doubt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0bebdbc3b662775d06d0071ab4bad32f7b7546","amp;dn":"ComicPirates+Weeklies+Archive+%28CPWA%29+%282012-04+-+2014-10%29+%28N%3D616%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0bebdbc3b662775d06d0071ab4bad32f7b7546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,11,235,219,195,182,98,119,93,6,208,7,26,180,186,211,47,123,117,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
