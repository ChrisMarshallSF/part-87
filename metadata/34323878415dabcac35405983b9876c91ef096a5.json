He then talks about the Bill Cosby rape allegations and the memeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that have popped up because of it, takes a few calls, and goes through MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mail. Ant talks about Jose Canseco being an idiot, the newest ISIS beheading, we hear an Ebola song, and watch a classic OA video. The show ends with a list of mysterious photos that cannot be explained, witnessing a sexy strip tease from Jesse Ventura, and by hearing a news story on Ã¢â‚¬Å“vacation breasts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34323878415dabcac35405983b9876c91ef096a5","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-17.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34323878415dabcac35405983b9876c91ef096a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,50,56,120,65,93,171,202,195,84,5,152,59,152,118,201,30,240,150,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
