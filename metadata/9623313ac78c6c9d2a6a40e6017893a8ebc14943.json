It's old, and I had already watched it. Generally I watch these after I convert them to make sure they're not messed. This one I just did a quick scan through. Leave a comment if there's a problem as I have the raw file &amp; can reconvert it.\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE INDEPENDENTS (written by Matt Welch, taken from Reason)\n---------------------------\nMore than 100 million Americans now receive means-tested assistance from the federal government, according to data released this week by the Census. Scores of millions more receive old-age entitlements, targeted tax exemptions, and straight-up corporatist handouts. With a recovery still limping along, is this any way to run an economy?\n\nThat's the topic of tonight's episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three and five hours later), titled &quot;The United States of Welfare.&quot; \n\nThe show kicks off with Heritage Foundation Chief Economist Stephen Moore providing an overview of the history behind, successes of, and challenges to the Clinton/Gingrich 1990s welfare reform. The Wall Street JournalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jason Riley, author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make it Harder for Blacks to Succeed, will then come on to talk about the ballyhooed &quot;culture of dependency.&quot; Beloved Reason Senior Editor Peter Suderman arrives to talk about Medicaid and Obamacare, followed by Cato Institute Senior Fellow Michael Tanner, who will break down the recent unsustainable spike in disability claims.\n\nAnti-corporatist crusader Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner will declaim corporate welfare of the type dished out by the Export-Import Bank; Tom Palmer of Cato and the Atlas Economic Research Foundation will discuss the differences between (and interrelationship of) private and public charity, and the co-hosts will present their own ideas for welfare reform going forward. It's a richly informative program that will give you knowledge and intellectual ammunition no matter where you come out on the question of transfers to the poor and non-poor alike.\n\n\nINFO\n----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pass on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : The.Independents.2014.08.22.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 352 MiB \nDuration : 42mn 19s \nOverall bit rate : 1 162 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6b23020c032b2758455b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 42mn 19s \nBit rate : 1 023 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.117 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1023 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 42mn 19s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 38.7 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9623313ac78c6c9d2a6a40e6017893a8ebc14943","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.08.22.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9623313ac78c6c9d2a6a40e6017893a8ebc14943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,35,49,58,199,140,108,157,42,106,64,230,1,120,147,168,235,193,73,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
