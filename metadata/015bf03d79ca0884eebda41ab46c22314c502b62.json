They took his license away in LA, and fearing criminal prosecution, he split town in the middle of the night and headed for Las Vegas, where anyone can become anonymous.\nHe swears off the business, but his money runs low and when a man offers him $5000 to find his missing daughter, he agrees. He soon wishes he hadn't when the haunting memory of a woman from his past gets in the way.\nTemptation Town is a novelette, about 12,000 words, the first of the Jack Barnett series from Mike Dennis. Set in the steaming underbelly of Las Vegas, these tales of a reluctant ex-private investigator drag the reader down the darkest streets of Sin City, USA, a town in constant need of fresh blood for its own survival.\nThe book also comes with an exclusive preview of the second Jack Barnett installment, another novelette called HARD CASH. The third entry, a full novel called THE DOWNTOWN DEAL, is also currently available.\n\nBook #2 -- Hard Cash\nWhat if a total stranger gave you $95,000 in cash as he lay dying in the street? Do you keep it? Even after knowing who it really belongs to?\nIn this novelette by Mike Dennis, ex-private investigator Jack Barnett is handed such an envelope on a back street in Las Vegas. He needs the money, but as he learns more about it, he is drawn deeper into the world of a shady real estate mogul, whose reach extends all the way to a Texas border town, where bribery is the way things get done.\n\nBook #3 -- The Downtown Deal\nLas Vegas, October, 2003. Sandra Blake is dead. A bullet in her forehead. Her ex-husband has persuaded former private investigator Jack Barnett to find the killer. The investigation leads Barnett into a high-powered world of shady characters and a rising body count, all for control of a seemingly unimportant slice of vacant land in a seedy area of downtown Las Vegas. A mysterious case of wine rests at the center of it all, and everyone wants it. Can Barnett find the killer before the whole thing blows up in his face?\n\n\nNote:  I bought these..\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
