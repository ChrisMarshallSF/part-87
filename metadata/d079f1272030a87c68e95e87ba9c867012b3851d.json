Start Here shows they excel at catchy hooks, sweet melodies, and evocative moments. Their youthful perspective makes Ã¢â‚¬Å“Downside of Growing UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ required listening for high schoolers (and their parents). And their talent for flipping expectations reappears on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shut Up and Fish.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They flirt with pop but are committed to country, honky-tonk, and bluegrass traditionsÃ¢â‚¬â€making them a must for fans of Dixie Chicks and pre-1989 T-Swizzle. The line for the Maddie &amp; Tae bandwagon starts here. Climb aboard.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. WaitinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On A Plane 3:26\n02. Girl In A Country Song 3:38\n03. Smoke 3:03\n04.
