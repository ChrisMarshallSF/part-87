In the Western theater of war the Confederacy had the misfortune to face, with inferior resources, some of the outstanding Union leaders early in their careers. The Southern commanders who faced Grant, Sherman and Sheridan in these campaigns were of varied backgrounds and talents: some had been sent West in disfavour, others were foolishly quarrelsome, and after A.S.Johnston's death at Shiloh there was no single figure with the authority to dominate them. Some were nevertheless of the highest class: men like Joseph E.Johnston, the cavalry leader Nathan Bedford Forrest, and the little known Patrick Cleburne and Alexander Stewart earned ungrudging respect. This book details the careers, personalities and appearance of 24 generals of the Army of Tennessee and the other Confederate commands in the West","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7bee3b2705f39b27aee1a01727ff0205cdef2d","amp;dn":"American+Civil+War+Commanders+%284%29%3A+Confederate+Leaders+in+the+We","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7bee3b2705f39b27aee1a01727ff0205cdef2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,123,238,59,39,5,243,155,39,174,225,160,23,39,255,2,5,205,239,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
