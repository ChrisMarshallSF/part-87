Also take note that this movie's resolution is \n640x480 so it will not fit completely on modern 16:9 widescreen TV's without black bars on both sides of the picture. This aspect ratio is designed more for old full screen TV's. This is not my preferred resolution but there was no way of changing it without warping or cropping the picture. I would also take note that this movie is not what I would call outstanding quality for Standard Definition more along the lines of lower quality. I'm assuming its due to the age of the movie. Most Standard Definition movies off iTunes are of higher quality. However this is a top notch rip and its basically identical to the iTunes source and I've tested it. I like to keep my uploads honest. Enjoy. \n\n\nGeneral:\nFormat...............: MP4\nCodec................: H.264\nSource...............: iTunes\nDuration.............: 01:26:50\nLanguage.............: English\nFile Size............: 997MB\n\nVideo:\nResolution...........: 640x480\nFrame Rate...........: 23.976\nAvg Bitrate..........: 1473 kbps\nSubtitles............: None\n\nAudio\nCodec................: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)\nChannels.............: Stereo\nBitrate..............: 128 kbps\nSample Rate..........: 48000 Hz\n\n\n\nAVINAPTIC REPORT\n\n\nAbout file\n\nName                        Living the Life.mp4\nDate                        Mon, 06 Oct 2014 13:59:47 -0400\nSize                        1,046,075,737 bytes (997.615563 MiB)\nNote                        Analysis not complete\n\nMagic\n\nFile type                   ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1\n\nGeneric infos\n\nDuration                    01:26:50 (5210.094 s)\nContainer                   MP4/MOV\nMajor brand                 ISO Base Media version 512\nCompatible brands           JVT AVC\nCreation time               Thu, 31 Dec 1903 20:00:00 -0400\nModification time           Mon, 06 Oct 2014 13:59:47 -0400\nTotal tracks                3\nTrack nr. 1                 audio (mp4a) [SoundHandler]\nTrack nr. 2                 video (avc1) [VideoHandler]\nTrack nr. 3                 text (text) []\n\nRelevant data\n\nResolution                  640 x 480\nWidth                       multiple of 32\nHeight                      multiple of 32\n\nVideo track\n\nCodec                       avc1\nResolution                  640 x 480\nFrame aspect ratio          4:3 = 1.333333\nPixel aspect ratio          1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio        4:3 = 1.333333\nFramerate                   23.976 fps\nBitrate                     1473.95638 kbps\n\nAudio track\n\nCodec                       mp4a\nBitrate                     127.95414 kbps\nBitstream type (bs)         AAC LC (Low Complexity)\nSampling frequency (bs)     44100 Hz\nMode (bs)                   2: front-left, front-right\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\nQuality is Guaranteed No BS Uploads\n                             \nTested and working on XBOX 360 and Apple TV\n                             \nPlease seed and Comment\n\n\nThanks Enjoy\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e75e502ba53065236af70304372347481157e76","amp;dn":"Living+the+Life_2000_480p_WEB-DL_H264_MP4_BADASSMEDIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e75e502ba53065236af70304372347481157e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,117,229,2,186,83,6,82,54,175,112,48,67,114,52,116,129,21,126,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
