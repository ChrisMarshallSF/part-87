This means a couple things: 1) I don't know if they exist at all, but if they do 2) I don't know the sound quality. Regardless, I found this 78 and transferred it (albeit with a stereo LP stylus, not a 78 stylus), and it sounded good, so I thought I'd share it. It truly is rare to find a 78 RPM record in this good of shape, so, if it is valuable, the world deserves to have it. It's here for you now, so do please enjoy!\n\n\nTRANSFER/MASTERING INFO:\nThe disc was transferred at 33 1/3 RPM (quartz lock engaged) into Adobe Audition at 48kH/16bit. I then passed it through a light pop filter (NOT harmful noise reduction) and removed the subsonic rumble AT Turntables famously leave behind. The result was incredibly clean. I exported to a FLAC and opened the file in Audacity, where the RIAA curve was removed before doubling the bitrate to 96kHz (to achieve an effective speed of 66 2/3 RPM) and speed correction by a factor of 17.39 to achieve the perfect 78.26 RPM. I then applied the correct EQ setting for King 78RPM records (500 Hz bass turnover frequency, -16db 10kHz Gain Rolloff, 50Hz LF Shelving Frequency). I then amplified the recording to maintain maximum dynamic range as well as loudness. Exporting back to FLAC, I imported the file back into Audition\nand did a lot of manual click/pop removal as well as sparse, small sections of the automatic heavy removal. The result from this long and tedious process is a record that sounds very clean and unplayed, which is incredibly difficult to find in 78RPM records, as only a few plays with the day's gigantic counterweights would give irreparable groove damage.\n\nIn order to improve sound quality, the transfers have been collapsed to mono, as the record was recorded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4c63b8942b317e3eae7832ff0f99b9a01d461b","amp;dn":"Jack+Dupree+%26amp%3B+Mr.+Bear+-+Walking+The+Blues+%2F+Daybreak+Rock+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4c63b8942b317e3eae7832ff0f99b9a01d461b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,76,99,184,148,43,49,126,62,174,120,50,255,15,153,185,160,29,70,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
