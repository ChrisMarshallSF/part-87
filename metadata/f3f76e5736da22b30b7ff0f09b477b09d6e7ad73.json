It was set in a home for old people. The Dutch title literally means, &quot;Yes, Sister; No, Sister&quot;; because in the Netherlands, as in Britain and many other countries, nurses of a certain rank are called &quot;Sister&quot;.\n\nThe series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes.\n\nThe script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.\n\nDutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.\n\nA film with the same title, based on the series, was produced in 2002. It starred Loes Luca as Zuster (Sister) Klivia and Paul Kooij as her landlord and nextdoor neighbour, Buurman Boordeval.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309725/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309725/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f76e5736da22b30b7ff0f09b477b09d6e7ad73","amp;dn":"Ja+zuster+Nee+zuster+-+Alle+58+liedjes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f76e5736da22b30b7ff0f09b477b09d6e7ad73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,247,110,87,54,218,34,179,11,127,240,240,155,71,123,9,214,231,173,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
