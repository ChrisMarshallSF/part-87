Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal - an act that begins to turn her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's successor and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom - and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.\n\n\nEnglish, French and Spanish audio and subtitles.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a758e96fc196c92e1a8035e9571847715e4eda8","amp;dn":"Maleficent+-+DVD9+-+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a758e96fc196c92e1a8035e9571847715e4eda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,117,142,150,252,25,108,146,225,168,3,94,149,113,132,119,21,228,237,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
