The Jedi Order is reestablished on the planet Yavin 4, and has continued to train new Jedi Knights in the art of peace and justice. But all is not peaceful in this new world. With the fall of the Galactic Empire, the ancient Skenvi Empire now comes out of the closet.\n\nThe Skenvi now oppose the New Republic for control over the galaxy with their languidly growing empire. The Skenvi seek to seize control of all the galaxy's most valuable resources to cripple their enemies. And if a planet refuses to join them, they have been known to take very aggressive actions.\n\nCaught in between this struggle over the fate of the galaxy is the little planet of Coreign. The planet possesses a very powerful resource that would greatly favour the side that has access to it if a galactic war was to emerge.\n\nIn its eagerness to gain access to Coreign's resources, the Skenvi Empire sends its most infamous negotiator, Lord Siege. He is a man who is known throughout the galaxy for seeing that the Skenvi Empire gets what it wants by all means necessary. The New Republic sends two of its Jedi ambassadors, Master Soran Darr and his padawan, Raven Darkham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eef5c4bbdf11699014da5eff67532454ea845db1","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Threads+of+Destiny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eef5c4bbdf11699014da5eff67532454ea845db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,245,196,187,223,17,105,144,20,218,94,255,103,83,36,84,234,132,93,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
