The two began writing riffs for their very first songs at the local Guitar Center. They acquired the powerful drums from Ian's brother Brodee, and a rhythmic bass sound from Tom. After long months of writing, Thomas Pinney became the new frontman and the band started playing shows.After a few months of successfully building a local fan base, creative differences strained the band and Thomas left to pursue other interests. Still frustrated and arguing, the band felt it necessary to move forward without Tom on bass, and Ascendancy was left with only three members. Adamant about carrying on, the band found new talent in Jimmy on bass, and he quickly became a vital member. After months of searching and trying out vocalists, Gustavo saw an online ad of Ascendancy and decided to audition. Weeks went by as the band cautiously tried him out, and he worked hard to earn his way into the frontman position of the band. Currently working on their first album, Ascendancy remains determined to reestablish heavy metal as a valid source of music in today's society.\nAscendancy, a heavy metal band, has just dropped their debut album &quot;Pinnacle of Creation&quot;. After listening to the album. This album is a MUST HAVE.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Darkest HorizonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the single off of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pinnacle of CreationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, has hit hard and heavy and has made made a huge impact. So much so, that it has been nominated to be part of The History Of Metal's top song list countdown for 2014. Now that is saying something when a single off your album makes that much noise when it hits. I took a peek at the lyric video they have for this song on their site and at the end of the song, my only thought was epic. (Check it out below)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“AbsolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I can say that when I first played it, it became a favorite of mine. Here is how it went down. I popped on the music, stuck in my ear buds and BAM! I was ready to do the wall of death and start a pit then and there (and I'm getting on a bit!!). Just when I thought it could not get any better, the double bass came on and made a fast song even harder. It was a metal eargasm that infiltrated my ears and thrashed my brains.\nIn short, I enjoyed this album from start to finish.\n\n\nTracklist:\n01. Pitch Black 04:10\n02. Lies 03:58\n03.
