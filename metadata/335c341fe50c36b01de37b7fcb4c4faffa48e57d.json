They first garnered attention in 2003, after winning second place in Experience Music Project's Sound Off! Competition. They continued on to make a debut album, The Funeral Sciences. 2005 saw the release of their second effort, Fantastic Wounds and a nationwide tour with Vendetta Red. They have been featured in the Seattle newspaper The Stranger.\n\nSinger Ryann Donnelly claims that the band has its roots in the year 2000, when she and the band attempted to play a cover of a Misfits song, &quot;Last Caress&quot;, but were cut off due to offensive lyricism (they were playing a Christian Battle of the Bands function).\n\nThe Heroes entered the studio on January 16, 2007, to record their third full-length record, titled Abominations. Recording wrapped on February 3, 2007, and the album was released on September 18, 2007 on a major-label, Stolen Transmission, for the first time. The band announced a nation-wide tour to showcase their new album.\n\nOn March 20, 2007, Schoolyard Heroes debuted a song on their PureVolume music page. &quot;Dude, Where's My Skin?&quot; went on to become the website's most downloaded song of the day. After a short 24-hour stint, the song was removed.\n\nIn early 2008, the band completed a nationwide tour, opening for the Seattle-based band Aiden.\n\nThe band announced their breakup on November 20, 2009.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, the band posted an announcement on their Myspace about a &quot;new project&quot; that they called Blood Cells.This is a band featuring both Jonah Bergman and Ryann Donnelly, as well as two new members. Their musical style is extremely similar to that of the Schoolyard Heroes, and they had announced through their email newsletter that they are working on new material, but later said it was an error.\n\nAfter a handful of Blood Cells shows, Ryann returned to playing dance pop solo shows and moved to New York. She has been releasing new songs through her own label The Lonely Hearts Singles Club.\n\nIn 2011, Jonah Bergman joined a resurrected Vendetta Red.\n\nIn 2014, the Schoolyard Heroes were announced as part of the Bumbershoot Festival lineup. Whether or not this is a one-time reunion remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nRyann Donnelly\nJonah Bergman\nSteve Bonnell\nBrian Turner\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Funeral Sciences (2003)\n\n\n\n01 Curse of the Werewolf\n02 All-You-Can-Eat Cancer\n03 The Mechanical Man vs. the Robot from the Outer Limits\n04 Dawn of the Dead\n05 Blood-Spattered Sundress\n06 Attack of the Puppet People\n07 Bury the Tooth of the Hydra and a Skeleton Army Will Arise\n08 The Klaw\n09 Michael Dudakoff- American Ninja\n10 Contra\n11 Boyfriend\n12 Sincerely Yours, Jonathon Harker\n\n\n\nFantastic Wounds (2005)\n\n\n\n01 Body Shots\n02 Panic In The Year Zero\n03 Serial Killers Know How To Party\n04 Centaur - Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\n05 They Live\n06 Battlestar Anorexia\n07 Nightmare At 20,000 Feet\n08 Funeral Parlour Tricks\n09 Nothing Cleanses Quite Like Fire\n10 The Girl Who Was Born Without A Face\n\n\n\nAbominations (2007)\n\n\n\n01 Dude, Where's My Skin\n02 The Plastic Surgery Hall Of Fame\n03 Cemetery Girls\n04 Violence Is All The Rage\n05 Children Of The Night\n06 The Last Man On Earth\n07 Razorblade Kisses\n08 Sometimes They Come Back\n09 Beautiful Woman Hunter\n10 All The Pretty Corpses\n11 Screaming ''Theater'' In A Crowded Fire\n\n\n\n\nGenre:\tPunk\nSubgenre:\tHorror-Punk / Alternative / Gothic / Shock Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t276.18 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n35 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335c341fe50c36b01de37b7fcb4c4faffa48e57d","amp;dn":"+Schoolyard+Heroes+-+Discography+%282003-2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335c341fe50c36b01de37b7fcb4c4faffa48e57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,92,52,31,229,12,54,176,29,227,123,127,203,76,79,175,250,72,229,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
