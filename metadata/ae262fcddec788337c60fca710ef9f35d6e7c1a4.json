He is committed, and she grows up with a new family, eventually going to college, where she joins a sorority. Due to a memory block, she doesn't remember that the sorority house was her childhood house. Her brother senses her presence in the house and escapes so he can finish the job he was unable to complete. \n\noriginal title:   Death House\nGenre:    Horror\nDirector:     Carol Frank\nWriter:     Carol Frank\nStars:      Angela O'Neill, Wendy Martel, Pamela Ross \nRelease Date:    October 1986 (USA) \nCountry:     USA\nLanguage:      English\nProduction Co:      Concorde Pictures\nRuntime:     74 min \nColor:     Color","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae262fcddec788337c60fca710ef9f35d6e7c1a4","amp;dn":"Sorority+House+Massacre+1986+DVDRiP.XViD-HoRRoRFReaKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae262fcddec788337c60fca710ef9f35d6e7c1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,38,47,205,222,199,136,51,124,96,252,167,16,239,159,53,214,231,193,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
