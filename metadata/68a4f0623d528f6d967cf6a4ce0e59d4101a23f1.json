Boon's death later that year in an auto accident.\n\nThe cover art is a painting by D. Boon depicting a meeting of three exhausted record label executives in which one of them says &quot;I got it! We'll have them write hit songs!&quot; Project: Mersh was a sarcastic and ironic attempt at a commercial (or &quot;mersh&quot;) recording rather than their &quot;econo&quot; method. Though, as bassist Mike Watt pointed out in a 1985 Bard College interview, &quot;It's only mersh because we said it was mersh, it only sold about half as much as our art record Double Nickels on the Dime.&quot; All six songs surpass the two-minute mark (&quot;More Spiel&quot; is nearly six minutes long) and incorporate verses, choruses, and hooks, and fade outs in contrast to nearly all the band's previous recordings.\n\n\n   1 &quot;The Cheerleaders&quot; (D.
