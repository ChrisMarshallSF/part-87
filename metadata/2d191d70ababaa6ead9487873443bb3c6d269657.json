Ant talks about racism on MSN, shows us a rebuttal video, learn Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂº10 ways white people can fight everyday racism,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ and we see the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºNigga Vs Nazi Challenge.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ We watch a video of pregnant bitches fighting, a car fight clip Ant calls shenanigans on, and get into a discussion thanks to a video regarding Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºcultureÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ from Ferguson. After Ant goes through some Monday mail goodies, we see a video of a man questioning a police officer, witness how bringing up the word Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºPaltalkÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ causes internet issues, and watch part of a dumb old Dean Cain flick. Ant talks about a news story involving an insane woman and a chimney, hot murderers, parents and kids, and he ends the show going through a list of odd things you can rent and with some sweet outro music by Brother Joe.\n\nNote: Split into two because of technical problems. The resolution is lower as well as Rat set it wrong on the new Tri-caster (you hear Ant ask why the graphics look like crap at one point)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d191d70ababaa6ead9487873443bb3c6d269657","amp;dn":"2014-10-20.The+Anthony+Cumia+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d191d70ababaa6ead9487873443bb3c6d269657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,25,29,112,171,171,170,110,173,148,135,135,52,67,187,60,109,38,150,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
