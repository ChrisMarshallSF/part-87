What they do not tell her is that Lillie had become a prostitute and was brutally murdered in the brothel where she had been living. When Beret discovers the sordid truth of Lillie' s death, she makes her way to Denver, determined to find her sister' s murderer. Detective Mick McCauley may not want her involved in the case, but Beret is determined, and the investigation soon takes her from the dangerous, seedy underworld of Denver' s tenderloin to the highest levels of Denver society. Along the way, Beret not only learns the depths of Lillie' s depravity, but also exposes the sinister side of Gilded Age ambition in the process. Sandra Dallas once again delivers a page-turner filled with mystery, intrigue, and the kind of intricate detail that truly transports you to another time and place","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a6a6516ca58335ab2222e0687cf0643c3220c1","amp;dn":"Sandra+Dallas-Fallen+Women","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a6a6516ca58335ab2222e0687cf0643c3220c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,166,166,81,108,165,131,53,171,34,34,224,104,124,240,100,60,50,32,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
