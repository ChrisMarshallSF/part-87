The once chaotic city of Akiba has regained its everyday hustle and bustle following the formation of the self-governing organization Round Table Meeting. The earthlings, who are originally from the game world, have gained the trust of Shiroe by waging a defensive war against the Goblins in Zantleaf Region. This has led Princess Rayneshia of the Cowen family, the highest-ranking Earthling Aristocrats, to live in Akiba.\n\n\nScreenshot:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage:\n\nAudio:\t\t\t\t\t : JAP\nText/Subs:\t\t\t\t : ENG/Spanish\n\nVideo:\n\nDuration                                 : 24mn 30s\nDuration                                 : 24mn 32s\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 24mn 32s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\nVideo Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\nSubtitle Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs/PayuSubs\n\nThanks in advance to all people who will seed the torrent for as long as they can. ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d3f27528c8623ceef8f1d492530d3e63c08181","amp;dn":"%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D+Log+Horizon+2+-+06+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d3f27528c8623ceef8f1d492530d3e63c08181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,211,242,117,40,200,98,60,238,248,241,212,146,83,13,62,99,192,129,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
