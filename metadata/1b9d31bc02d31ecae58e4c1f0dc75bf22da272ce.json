The First Amendment made my career possible. It allowed me to expose crooks and cheaters. Once, I had a female producer take my urine to two abortion clinics who said I was pregnant!\n\nThey would have given my producer a fake abortion had I not first said, &quot; No!&quot; I confronted those doctors, and they closed their practices and disappeared.\n\nEXPOSING THE TRUTH: The First Amendment also made citizen journalist James O'Keefe's career possible. O'Keefe complains that authorities prosecute him for violating privacy laws but don't go after activists on the left. Mother Jones won a Polk Award after they ran this illegally recorded undercover video of Mitt Romney.\n\nWE THE PEOPLE: Glenn Beck got huge ratings talking about the Constitution on TV. He once said our president &quot;fully intends to trash the constitution.&quot; Now, he says he's &quot;mellowed some,&quot; but he still thinks people are not standing up for the Constitution.\n\nRIGHT TO BEAR ARMS: I tried to get a legal permit to carry a gun, but officials said I hadn't proved a special need for it. That was in New York City. Chicago and Washington, DC have been forced to change laws to honor the Second Amendment. You should thank our founders for that.\n\nFEDERALISM: You've probably heard people call the states &quot;Laboratories of Democracy.&quot; What does it mean? Nick Gillespie of Reason.com says it's about state experimentation: &quot;[California] has high taxes and high services; [Texas] has low taxes and low services. People can sort based on which model they like.&quot;\n\nFOUNDER JOHN'S TAKE: Over the last century, Americans experimented, and we became the most prosperous country in the world. Our success is largely because our founders understood the dangers of big government and wrote a Constitution to limit them. We should pay more attention to it. Then we could have what Thomas Jefferson promised -- a &quot;wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits.&quot;\n\nfoxbusiness[.]com/on-air/stossel/blog/2014/10/15/constitution\n\n\nINFO:\n-----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB. (310 video 40 audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Stossel.2014.10.16.We.The.People.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 7s \nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f2ba9b959ab2bec1dcc2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 7s \nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 14.985 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9d31bc02d31ecae58e4c1f0dc75bf22da272ce","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.10.16.We.The.People.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9d31bc02d31ecae58e4c1f0dc75bf22da272ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,157,49,188,2,211,30,202,229,142,76,31,13,199,91,242,45,162,114,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
