Don Roy Doyle is back in town. Tough and quick-witted, he's fresh out of prison, where he served three years for a diamond swindle. Now he's back to collect his share of the proceeds, about $200,000, but the money has vanished. \nA local family dynasty which has controlled the island's politics for generations, a cop with a grudge, the FBI, and the Russian mob all have a stake in the action. They're convinced Cuba is on the verge of &quot;opening up&quot;, and they all want Doyle gone. \nIn this tightly-knit town, who can be trusted? And how long can Doyle stay alive? \nSetup on Front Street is the first novel in Mike Dennis' Key West Nocturnes series. It takes you deep inside the world of Key West noir, behind the margaritas and the sunshine, way back in the shadows and the alleys, where the tourists never go.\n\nBook #2 -- The Ghosts of Havana\nWhat if two murders, spaced nearly fifty years apart, turn out to be linked to a safe deposit box, whose contents hold the key to decades-old secrets and threaten national security? \nThe second exciting novel in Mike Dennis' Key West Nocturnes series, THE GHOSTS OF HAVANA is a tale of old vendettas that will not die. Mike Dennis continues to lift the veil off Key West, revealing it as a true noir city, on a par with Los Angeles, New Orleans, or Miami.\n\nBook #3 -- Man-Slaughter\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hot in the Florida Keys in August. For Teddy Myles, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even hotter as he tries to outrun both the law and his partners in crime. He flees to Key West to set up a new identity and an escape to the Caribbean. But he meets up with Gail, a sexy local, who has other things in mind for him. \nSoon, he finds himself trapped into pulling one more job, this one for over a million. His former partners are tracking him, the cops are onto him, and a hurricane is coming. \nTime is running out, but will it be on his side? \nMan-Slaughter is the third gripping novel in Mike Dennis' Key West Nocturnes Series, designed to reveal Key West as a true noir city.\n\n\nNote: Bought Book #2 + #3\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
