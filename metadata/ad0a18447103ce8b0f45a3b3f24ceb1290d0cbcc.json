The big difference, is that while there are many paths/choices you can make, there is only one ending (The End), and you have to make all the right choices to get to it.\n\nSome personal notes; While I was scanning in this book (Tenopia #4) I put too much pressure on the spine, trying to flatten it out for a good scan... chunks of the pages separated from the spine of this book, and there are a few pages where you can see the pages coming apart in the scan. I still did the best I could to scan in the entire book, but a few of the pages in this look funky (you can still read it just fine).  The book itself is nearly 28 years old...\n\nAlso, I renamed the file/torrent so that it'd fit in 64 characters (tpb's limit), and so it's been shortened to &quot;Star System&quot; instead of &quot;Star System Tenopia&quot;\n\nHere's all the Tenopia books:\n#1 Tenopia Island, by Edward Packard\n#2 Trapped in the Sea Kingdom, by Richard Brightfield\n#3 Terror on Kabran, by Richard Brightfield\n#4 Star System Tenopia by Richard Brightfield\t\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0a18447103ce8b0f45a3b3f24ceb1290d0cbcc","amp;dn":"Escape+from+Tenopia+4+Star+System-Choose+Your+Own+Adventure.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0a18447103ce8b0f45a3b3f24ceb1290d0cbcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,10,24,68,113,3,206,139,15,69,163,179,242,76,235,18,144,208,203,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
