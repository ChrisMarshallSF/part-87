Every year however, he works as a department store Santa Claus. This year however, he's spent just a little too much time in the bar and is quite drunk by the time he shows up for work. He's fired of course and deeply regrets what he's done. In fact, Henry has a big heart and worries not only about the children he's disappointed at the store but about all of those children who will not get what they've asked for Christmas. When he comes across a large bag of gifts, everything changes for the kids and for himself as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e430348259837945b66e4b10426532d8f72e7f05","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Night+Of+The+Meek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e430348259837945b66e4b10426532d8f72e7f05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,48,52,130,89,131,121,69,182,110,75,16,66,101,50,216,247,46,127,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
