It is notable as being the first official retrospective release from McCartney's post-Beatles career. Excepting interest in its vinyl LP mix, this collection has become largely irrelevant since the releases of All the Best! and Wingspan: Hits and History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd8f432c841a42233b2d71749224010a90aad7cb","amp;dn":"Wings+-+Wings+Greatest+%281978%3B+1984+Japan%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd8f432c841a42233b2d71749224010a90aad7cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,143,67,44,132,26,66,35,59,45,113,116,146,36,1,10,144,170,215,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
