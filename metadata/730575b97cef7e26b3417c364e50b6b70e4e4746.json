The song is the fourth and most recent song in the ongoing saga of &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; (other songs include &quot;Charlotte the Harlot,&quot; &quot;22 Acacia Avenue,&quot; and &quot;Hooks in You&quot;, although the status of the latter song is a point of debate among fans since it does not actually mention &quot;Charlotte&quot;, just &quot;the keys to a view at number 22&quot;). The songs tells the tale of Charlotte going on a fateful motorcycle ride with the Devil.\n\nThis is the first studio single to not feature Eddie in the artwork - second overall, after the live version of &quot;Running Free&quot; - using a picture of the song's music video instead. The cover of the 7&quot; Etched Disc is the cover most people associate with the single, though the 12&quot; was a very different picture from the clip. The CD Maxi used the 7&quot; etched cover, but a different shot again from the clip is on the Netherlands release of the CD.    \n\nIt charted and peaked at #21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (Steve Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Roll Over Vic Vella&quot; (Chuck Berry cover with different lyrics) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n    &quot;I Can't See My Feelings&quot; (Budgie cover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n    &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; (live - Wembley Arena, 10/17/90) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:23\n    &quot;Public Enema Number One&quot; (live - Wembley Arena, 10/17/90)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:57\n    &quot;Hooks In You&quot; (live - Wembley Arena, 10/17/90) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:730575b97cef7e26b3417c364e50b6b70e4e4746","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+From+Here+To+Eternity+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"730575b97cef7e26b3417c364e50b6b70e4e4746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,5,117,185,124,239,126,38,179,65,124,54,78,80,182,183,14,78,71,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
