The only takers are two eccentric Englishmen who want to embark for the other side of the globe. The Reverend Geoffrey Wilson believes the Garden of Eden was on the island of Tasmania. His traveling partner, Dr. Thomas Potter, unbeknownst to Wilson, is developing a sinister thesis about the races of men.\n\nMeanwhile, an aboriginal in Tasmania named Peevay recounts his peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggles against the invading British, a story that begins in 1824, moves into the present with approach of the English passengers in 1857, and extends into the future in 1870. These characters and many others come together in a storm of voices that vividly bring a past age to life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:801ae2e676c128d2d63426493fa8619be6e4241b","amp;dn":"English+Passengers+by+Matthew+Kneale+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"801ae2e676c128d2d63426493fa8619be6e4241b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,26,226,230,118,193,40,210,214,52,38,73,63,168,97,155,230,228,36,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
