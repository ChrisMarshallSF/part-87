This album marked a significant change in Divine Styler's musical direction, incorporating a much broader range of styles and influences than 1989's Word Power. Despite the album's unusual style, it was actually released by a major label but, perhaps inevitably, failed to sell as well as record executives expected. Although the album was largely regarded as a commercial failure, it has since developed a large cult following. Styler was signed to Giant because of Ice-TÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThe album is notoriously experimentalÃ¢â‚¬â€Allmusic referred to the album as being like '&quot;The Residents meets Funkadelic&quot; and takes influence from a wide variety of music genres such as hip hop, rock, electronic, funk and even elements of spoken word and noise.\n\nThe majority of the album was produced and arranged by Divine Styler himself, which included him performing and processing all of the vocals, playing the guitar, drums (and drum programming), and keyboards, among other instruments. Due to the artist's dominance over the album's direction, it is generally regarded as a very introspective and personal album.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Am I An Epigram For Life - 1:44\n02.
