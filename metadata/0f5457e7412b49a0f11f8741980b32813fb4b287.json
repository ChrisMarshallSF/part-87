It has been acclaimed as one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time.\n\nThe 1993 live single is taken from the 1993 album A Real Dead One. The song was recorded at Moscow's Olympic Arena on 4 June 1993 during the Real Live Tour.  Recordings from the same tour and its predecessor, 1992's Fear of the Dark Tour, made up the single's B-sides. It is the band's last single to feature vocalist Bruce Dickinson until 2000's &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.\n\n&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; has remained in almost all of the band's set-lists since the album's recording, the only exception being the Maiden England World Tour 2012Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14. Allmusic describes it as &quot;perhaps the most celebrated of the band's extended epics; it's the tale of a prisoner about to be hanged, featuring some of Harris' most philosophical lyrics.&quot; Several band-members have since stated that it is one of their favourite tracks, with Bruce Dickinson describing it as &quot;fantastic&quot; and that performing it live is like &quot;narrating a movie to the audience.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\n    &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (studio)(Harris) - 7:11\n    &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (live - Moscow 4 June 1993) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:26\n    &quot;The Trooper&quot; (live - Finland 27 August 1992) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;Wasted Years&quot; (live - Germany 16 April 1993) (Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n    &quot;Wrathchild&quot; (live - Finland 27 August 1992) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5457e7412b49a0f11f8741980b32813fb4b287","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Hallowed+Be+Thy+Name+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5457e7412b49a0f11f8741980b32813fb4b287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,84,87,231,65,43,73,160,241,31,135,65,152,11,50,129,63,180,178,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
