Director Peter Harris\n\nGuest Stars: Bobby McFerrin, Marc Weiner\n\nMiss Piggy's Hollywood Guest Stars: Dudley Moore, George Wendt, Justine Bateman, and Bob Hope.\n\n\nKermit struggles to keep the show's ratings up, while Digit experiences a malfunction which Lindbergh tries to fix with a sledehammer. Bean Bunny proves strangely popular, and Waldo and Vicki change the show's format with technology. Featuring:\n\n-Bobby McFerrin and the Graffiti Muppets.\n-A documentary about the tranquility of nature turns into a war film, as caterpillars and butterflies try to destroy each other\n-Hurting Something, a yuppie drama from another planet\n-Gorilla Television: Ubu, Chip and Zondra interrupt the MuppeTelevision broadcast to feature Marc Weiner and his puppet Rocko\n-Bobby McFerrin reads the musical news, with the Muppet Newsman providing interpretation for the totally unhip\n-Link Hogthrob is at the mercy of the Response-o-Matic, a machine which changes the genre of the show based on what the audience wants to see\n-Bean Bunny and the cast sing &quot;La Bamba.&quot;\n\n(This script was intended as the first episode, and it is sometimes called &quot;First Show.&quot;)\n\n\nMiss Piggy's Hollywood:\n\nMiss Piggy and her associate producer Gonzo attempt to take viewers on a star-studded trip around Hollywood and fail miserably. The concept is built around how Hollywood is home of the &quot;family of the stars,&quot; but Piggy's encounters with actual stars are either near-misses (Bob Hope arrives after she's left) or rather one-sided (cornering George Wendt at his tailor's, while Justine Bateman shoves Piggy into a swimming pool).\n\nMeanwhile, Fozzie Bear tries to find his way to the famous nightclub, the Comedy Store, for a perpetually delayed special report. The show closes with a Miss Piggy-obsessed Dudley Moore finally meeting his idol and singing a duet with her, &quot;Our Love Is Here To Stay.&quot;\n\nFeatured Hollywood and Los Angeles locations include Grauman's Chinese Theater, Universal Studios, Rodeo Drive, the Tail o' the Pup hot dog stand, and even a brief glimpse of the Bullwinkle statue on sunset strip.\n\nJim Henson - Kermit the Frog, Link Hogthrob, Waldorf, The Newsman\nCamille Bonora as Fern\nFran Brill as Vicki, Zondra\nKevin Clash as Leon, Bob the Game Show Host\nDave Goelz as Digit, Gonzo\nRichard Hunt as Statler\nFrank Oz as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear\nDan Redican as Anthony\nGord Robertson as Lindbergh\nBob Stutt as Ubu\nSteve Whitmire as Bean Bunny, Waldo C.

Titles are from laserdisc. Miss Piggy's Hollywood is motion-converted from a PAL DVD, with some footage filled in from VHS. Some special effects trickery was required to make the DVD and VHS sources match.\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe Jim Henson Hour Episode 1\n\nOuter Space / Louie Anderson / The Storyteller: The Heartless Giant\n\nApril 14, 1989, NBC. Director Wayne Moss.\n\nGuest Star: Louie Anderson\n\n\nThe first episode is themed around science fiction. Digit tells Kermit that he can pick up shows from other planets. Eventually, Digit breaks down, so Kermit, Lindbergh, and Waldo C. Graphic go inside Digit's brain to get him fixed.\n\nThe Extremes sing &quot;Neutron Dance.&quot;\n\nIn &quot;My Dinner with Codzilla.&quot; Louie Anderson and Codzilla have a dinner date.\n\nMiss Galaxy Pageant hosted by Marty the Earthling.\n\nWar and Peace, part 1: War\n\nBootsie and Brad become astronauts.\n\nWaldo helps Kermit and Lindbergh try to fix Digit from inside his head.\n\nLouie Anderson stars in The Adventures of Space Guy, with his crew of lobsters under attack by an army of bunnies, led by Bean.\n\nThe Muppets and their alternate-universe equivalents The Teppums sing &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo.&quot;\n\n\nThe Storyteller: &quot;The Heartless Giant&quot;\nA young prince is tricked into helping a heartless giant escape from the king's dungeon.

The five main Fraggle characters try to find new jobs after the last episode has been taped. They mention the names of many members of the crew, as they notice how strange it is without them around.\n\nThis version has been restored by Garrett Gilchrist, ending with footage from the wrap party itself.\nThe wrap tape closes with a new song to the tune of &quot;Children of Tomorrow.&quot;\n\nJerry Nelson as Gobo\nSteve Whitmire as Wembley\nKathryn Mullen as Mokey\nDave Goelz as Boober\nKaren Prell as Red\nRichard Hunt as the director (himself)\nGerry Parkes\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nAlternate audio on The Jim Henson Hour Episode 5\n(Ratings / Bobby McFerrin / Miss PiggyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hollywood)\nThe restored audio was taken from several different VHS recordings. I've included mixes based on the best and second best audio sources, for comparison's sake.\n\nBobby McFerrin Alternate Jim Henson opening:\nThis episode originally aired on Mother's Day in the U.S., and Jim mentioned the holiday in his introduction. Here is that version.\n\nLouie Anderson Alternate Ending:\nHere's what the &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; song sequence looks like with the color effects removed.\n\nChromosaurus (Don Venhaus, Pacific Data Images, 1985)\nThis early example of CGI animation appears on the monitors in every Jim Henson Hour episode.\n\nFraggles Look For Jobs (Fraggle Rock Wrap Party mini-episode)\n\nReconstructed Jim Henson Hour trailers: Ted Danson, Louie Anderson, Smokey Robinson, KD Lang, Buster Pointdexter, Dog City\n\nEight alternate intros: &quot;The Jim Henson Show&quot; (web quality)\nEight episodes of &quot;The Jim Henson Show&quot; aired in Canada. This was a half-hour version of The Jim Henson Hour, including all the MuppetTelevision episodes with Kermit and company, minus the cold openings (and closings) and without The Storyteller and the other fantasy features. (Dog City, Secrets of the Muppets, Living With Dinosaurs and Monster Maker were not included.) Jim Henson's introduction to each episode was different (though shot at the same time).
