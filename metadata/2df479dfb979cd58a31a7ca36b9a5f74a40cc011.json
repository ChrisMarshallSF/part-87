We go through Smuggs rebuttal video, talk about how being on-line invites bashing, and how technology causes an invasion of privacy. Lady Di attempts to call in, we hear about a Venezuelan teacher sexcapade, and Ant goes through MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mail. Lahna Turner joins Ant in studio to talk about what people find inappropriate these days, her husband Ralphie May, we see their Ã¢â‚¬Å“sex tape,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and learn about kids being cock blocks. They get into a little relationship talk, chat about addictions, we hear about LahnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new special Ã¢â‚¬Å“So I Wrote a Song About ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the TV show she's on called Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to be a Grown Up,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Lahna sings a few songs for the viewers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df479dfb979cd58a31a7ca36b9a5f74a40cc011","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df479dfb979cd58a31a7ca36b9a5f74a40cc011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,244,121,223,185,121,205,88,163,26,124,163,107,154,95,116,164,12,192,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
