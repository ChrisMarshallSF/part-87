EYES LIKE SKY AND COAL AND MOONLIGHT brings together twenty stories from the extraordinary talent of fantasy author Cat Rambo. Here are tales from seaport city of Tabat, both before and after the sorcerous wars that destroyed the Old Continent. Here are alchemical explanations for failed blind dates. Here you'll find a dryad, the last great elephant, and an uneasy blur of humanity. Cat Rambo doesn't simply amaze and delight, she restores wonder to her readers with every page. You won't simply believe that pigs can fly, you'll question why you ever doubted the premise at all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5c76a400114432ab89485fd0da6bfda6d0ff2e","amp;dn":"Eyes+Like+Sky+and+Coal+and+Moonlight+by+Cat+Rambo+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5c76a400114432ab89485fd0da6bfda6d0ff2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,92,118,164,0,17,68,50,171,137,72,95,208,218,107,253,166,208,255,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
