It has a lavastorm and LDoN graphic fix, and a much expanded _readme.txt file with instructions and other info.\n\nThis Underfoot copy is probably originally from a Steam distribution. My version here has all the file fixes as suggested by the EqEMU community plus a few others that were found to be necessary. It was designed with the THF flavor of EQEmu in mind. It does not have any of the THF customization files in it. Thats up to YOU to do. Please read the _readme.txt file for further info. Oh, and if your OS is Windows 7, do NOT use it to unzip this file. It will silently fail. Use one of the many freebie unzippers out there on the internet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f813d461616f5a8bc910895ebfedca5a925de456","amp;dn":"Everquest_UF_Steam_THF%28Jat20141124%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f813d461616f5a8bc910895ebfedca5a925de456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,19,212,97,97,111,90,139,201,16,137,94,191,237,202,90,146,93,228,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
