Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.\n\nStars: Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster, Cam Gigandet\n\n\n---------------\n\nSample and Trailer included\n\n---------------\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy !\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c82d86c7f6d09f9e170300a4f64549500c59cf8","amp;dn":"Pandorum.2009.BDrip.Avi-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c82d86c7f6d09f9e170300a4f64549500c59cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,130,216,108,127,109,9,249,225,112,48,10,79,100,84,149,0,197,156,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
