Under the auspices of the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, around 80 international experts met to review the state of scientific knowledge. This book reports their analysis. It concludes that threshold levels for ammonia effects have been underestimated and sets new values, it assesses the independent evidence to verify reported reductions in regional ammonia emissions, and it reviews the uncertainties in modelling ammonia, both in &quot;hot spots&quot; and at the regional scale","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c83d5de13975f8dcfa6388947a5ce7dab062b0","amp;dn":"Atmospheric+Ammonia+-+Detecting+Emission+Changes+and+Environment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c83d5de13975f8dcfa6388947a5ce7dab062b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,200,61,93,225,57,117,248,220,250,99,136,148,122,92,231,218,176,98,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
