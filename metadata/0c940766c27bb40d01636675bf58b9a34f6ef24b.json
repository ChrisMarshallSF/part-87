Everything is played straight, so it's more like Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity...except with way more nudity, and way less plot.\n\nYou'll see it called a &quot;Pornographic Dr. Who parody,&quot; but the only thing that links it to the British programme is the Daleks. (Look Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem up on Wikipedia.) And there's really no pornography...just some really hot, really naked women running around and being restrained at times. No sex, not even anything close to it, aside from some lesbian caressing. So it's more of a sexploitation film.\n\nBut the fun part is, when this was film came out in 2005, the BBC and the estate of Dalek creator Terry Nation took action to prevent sale of the DVD. It was initially released in a limited edition of 1000 discs on eBay, and then removed after their complaint.\n\nAnother &quot;limited edition&quot; was then released under the new title &quot;Abducted by the Daloids,&quot; in an attempt to avoid copyright claims (although the Dalek name remained in onscreen dialog).\n\nIncluded on the DVD (and here) is the full feature, plus a 36 minute outtakes/alternate version, and trailers.\n\nNOTE: the feature video includes TWO AUDIO TRACKS...one is the normal film, and the other has a Russian voiceover added in. So you might need to switch the English only track.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.terazfilms.co.uk/FILMS/abd/html/abd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.terazfilms.co.uk/FILMS/abd/html/abd.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://terazfilms.com/store/abducted-by-the-daloids-dvd-p-12.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://terazfilms.com/store/abducted-by-the-daloids-dvd-p-12.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c940766c27bb40d01636675bf58b9a34f6ef24b","amp;dn":"Abducted+by+the+Daleks.Daloids.2005.Stella.Teraz.Doctor+Who.sexy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c940766c27bb40d01636675bf58b9a34f6ef24b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,148,7,102,194,123,180,13,1,99,102,117,191,88,185,163,79,110,242,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
