He shows us video of the NASA rocket that exploded, introduces us to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smuggs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we go through a list of the most photographed places in the world, and then he takes a few calls. We hear about some ridiculous internet scam stories, one about a dirty janitor, and discuss drone use and see a video of a few in action. Ant talks about Jose ConsecoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gun mishap, Charles Barkley, Pope FrancisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Big Bang theory, Keith Olbermann, and the website Gawker. Before the show ends, we see part of a Sarah Palin interview and look at vintage advertisements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91fbf28b821f7d52bcdc0406648be50700378c5","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91fbf28b821f7d52bcdc0406648be50700378c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,31,191,40,184,33,247,213,43,205,192,64,102,72,190,80,112,3,120,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
