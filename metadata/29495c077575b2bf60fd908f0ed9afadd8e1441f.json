This doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean those researchers have agreed with each other, or with current ideas, but their conclusions were controversial and startling to a consensus often complicit in the criminalization and political repression of gays and lesbians. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard the last name on that list above, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably a good reason: HirschfeldÃ¢â‚¬â€a gay, Jewish physician, sexologist, and advocate in Weimar GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â€had much of his work burned by the Nazis in their 1933 rise to power.\n\nOne of HirschfeldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works destroyed in Nazi fires was a film he co-wrote and co-starred in called Different From the Others, the first gay rights movie in history. Released in 1919, and banned in 1920, the film explored a doomed relationship between a violinist, played by silent star Conrad Veidt, and his student. Extensive flashback scenes show both charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ early sexual experiences, their failed attempts to change their sexual orientation (including treatment with bogus Ã¢â‚¬Å“ex-gayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ therapies), and their eventual self-acceptance. In their present day, the couple is openly affectionate, until the violinist is blackmailed and dragged into court by an extortionist, then abandoned by his friends and family. He commits suicide, and his lover vows to fight the law that criminalized homosexuality in Germany, known as Paragraph 175.\n\nDifferent From the Others would be lost to history were it not for HirschfeldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preservation of 40 minutes of footage in a separate documentary. You can view the surviving film above, with English title cards. The film was part of a didactic series on themes of sexuality that Hirschfeld made with director Richard Oswald. In each one, Hirschfeld appears as a doctor who intervenes on behalf of persecuted individuals. In Different from the Others, he does so with the violinistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents, telling them, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You must not condemn your son because he is a homosexual, he is not to blame for his orientation. It is not wrong, nor should it be a crime. Indeed, it is not even an illness, merely a variation, and one that is common to all of nature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0009878/\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/movies/different-from-the-others-a-1919-film-on-homosexuality.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/movies/different-from-the-others-a-1919-film-on-homosexuality.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/para175.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/para175.asp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29495c077575b2bf60fd908f0ed9afadd8e1441f","amp;dn":"Richard+Oswald+-+Different+From+the+Others+%281919%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29495c077575b2bf60fd908f0ed9afadd8e1441f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,73,92,7,117,117,178,191,96,253,144,143,14,217,175,173,216,225,68,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
