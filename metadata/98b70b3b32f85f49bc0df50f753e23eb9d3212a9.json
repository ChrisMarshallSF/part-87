Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\n40_16 r1\n - updated Quickfort Community plans set to v2.2\n - updated PerfectWorld to v1.9\n** updated Dwarf Fortress to 0.40.16\n - updated PyLNP to v0.8a\n - updated utilities config; finally add descriptive tooltips!\n - removed some old content from defaults and extras\n - added tileset options for TwbT; use the graphics/customisation tab to set FONT\n - added Dwarf Therapist memory layout for 40.16\n - updated default embark profiles\n - updated DFHack to 40.16-r1\n - updated TwbT to v5.33\n - added Putnam's script &quot;remove-stress&quot;; removes stress of selected unit or &quot;remove-stress all&quot; to affect all units.\n\n\nMD5 CHECKSUM:\tE2B6C0C3960A1E0817C36FA5FFC958A3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b70b3b32f85f49bc0df50f753e23eb9d3212a9","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_16+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b70b3b32f85f49bc0df50f753e23eb9d3212a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,183,11,59,50,248,95,73,188,13,245,15,117,62,35,235,157,50,18,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
