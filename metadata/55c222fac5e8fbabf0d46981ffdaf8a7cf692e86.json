The most obvious difference is the quantity of songs: while The Best of Alexander O'Neal functioned as a suitable introduction covering the singer's first three albums, this disc features five more sensibly picked cuts. The most important inclusion here, beyond all the essential chart hits (&quot;If You Were Here Tonight,&quot; &quot;Criticize,&quot; &quot;Fake,&quot; &quot;Never Knew Love Like This,&quot; &quot;All True Man,&quot; &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;), is &quot;Saturday Love,&quot; the magnificent 1986 single previously bound to duet partner Cherrelle's catalog. Alexander O'Neal (1985), Hearsay (1986), and All True Man (1991) are all worth owning, but this compilation will do for those on a budget.\nAll Music Review by Andy Kellman  \n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Never Knew Love Like This\n[02] Innocent - Alex 9000 - Innocent II (Medley)\n[03] Fake\n[04] All True Man\n[05] Criticize [Single Version]\n[06] Saturday Love\n[07] If You Were Here Tonight\n[08] Hearsay '89\n[09] (What Can I Say) To Make You Love Me\n[10] The Lovers\n[11] What's Missing\n[12] A Broken Heart Can Mend\n[13] What Is This Thing Called Love\n[14] You Were Meant To Be My Lady (Not My Girl) [Single Version]\n[15] Love Makes No Sense [Single Version]\n\nPlay Time - 01h:17m:14s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 575mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
