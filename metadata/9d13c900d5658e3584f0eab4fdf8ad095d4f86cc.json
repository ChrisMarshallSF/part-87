Considering the non-commercial scope of the series any music could be used, free of charge. The variety of the selected music ranged from classical and ethnical music, to Vangelis' and Jean-Michel Jarre's synthesized pieces taken from their seventies albums.\n\nThe liner notes of &quot;The music of Cosmos&quot; - Collector's Edition explain:\n\n&quot;The musical content of COSMOS seemed to create a message of it's own - almost as though it were the collective intelligence of the universe pleasantly calling our attention to the lessons at hand. [this]... expresses, simply and eloquently, our intentions in selecting music for the thirteen hours of the COSMOS television series. As with the golden phonograph record placed on board the Voyager spacecraft, bearing a sampling of &quot;Earth's Greatest Hits&quot;, we included a variety of musical traditions and genres. Many hours were spent exploring the music of unfamiliar composers and performers, and considering how old favorites would enhance the thoughtful words and rich visuals of the series. Finding the music for COSMOS was in itself a voyage of discovery. We hope you will share in that experience, enjoy the music of this album and then sample the original works from which these pieces were excerpted. It was always our intention in COSMOS that the images and the music would be as important as the words, and that the series would speak to that part of us in which the heart and mind are one&quot;\n\n-- Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan and Steven Soter\n\n\nAlbum Name: The Music Of Cosmos\nAlbum Artist: Various Artists\nYear: 1980\nGenre: Electronic, Various\nBit Rate: 283.00 Kibit/s (average)\nTracks: 18\nSize: 89.44 MiB\nArtwork Embedded: Yes\nTracks Scraped/Tagged: Yes, with MediaMonkey and beaTunes\n\n01.
