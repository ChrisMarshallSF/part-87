The flow and point of the movie wasn't actually heavy-handed (sensitive raw nerves excluded), but went to the point of Christianity and the God-given right of freewill, along the way refuting the sophomoric-yet-ultimate 'show-stopper' argument of moralistic-atheists, 'How can a God who is (considered) good allow bad?'.  This enjoyable movie is guaranteed to promote thought and discussion.\n\nDescription...\nWhat do you believe?\n\nPresent-day college freshman and devout Christian, Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), finds his faith challenged on his first day of Philosophy class by the dogmatic and argumentative Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo). Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is DeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on pieces of paper as instructed, Josh finds himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: if Josh will not admit that Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is Dead,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he must prove GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence, he will fail the course and hinder his lofty academic goals.\n\nWith almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it just be easier just to write Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Is DeadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and put the whole incident behind him? GODÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOT DEAD weaves together multiple stories of faith, doubt and disbelief, culminating in a dramatic call to action. The film will educate, entertain, and inspire moviegoers to explore what they really believe about God, igniting important conversations and life-changing decisions.\n\nGODÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S NOT DEAD features a talented cast of actors including Kevin Sorbo (SOUL SURFER, HERCULES, ANDROMEDA), Shane Harper (GOOD LUCK CHARLIE, HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2), David A.R. White (BROTHER WHITE, REVELATION ROAD and JERUSALEM COUNTDOWN), and Dean Cain (LOIS &amp; CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN), with special appearances by Christian super-band Newsboys and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duck DynastyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Willie and Korie Robertson.\nAlso included are our End-Times and Xtras folders\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
