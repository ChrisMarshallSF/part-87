In this Halloween special Alice Roberts overcomes her arachnophobia to enter a spider-filled house where an astonishing drama unfolds within its walls.\n\nInside she meets entomologist Tim Cockerill, who loves spiders and quickly immerses Alice in the wonders of web building, the secrets of fly catching and the dangerous spider-eat-spider world they inhabit. Tim wants us to welcome spiders into our homes. Think of all the flies and unwanted insects they kill. He takes Alice on a macro-mystery tour of the rooms of the Spider House, revealing what goes on in the cracks and crannies of our homes. \n\nWhy do we always find spiders in the bathroom? They seem to lie in wait in our bathtubs. And what happens if we flush them down the plughole? Using powerful macro-photography, Tim and Alice find out. In the dining room, they uncover the complex engineering behind the most beautifully constructed 'dinner plate' in the home - a spider's web. In the kitchen Alice witnesses the extraordinary hunting ability of the keen-eyed jumping spider, while Tim finds out how spiders kill their prey using venom. In the bedroom, the secrets of spider courtship are revealed. For spiders, mating is a high-stakes life-or-death game, where males risk being eaten by females. In the nursery, we enter an enchanting cocoon where tiny spiderlings struggle out of their exoskeletons - the first of many moults on the road to becoming adult spiders. Meanwhile, down in the cellar, we meet an unexpectedly voracious killer - the daddy longlegs. Many of us have a love-hate relationship with spiders. The rational side of Alice Roberts understands their benefits, but can she overcome her irrational fears? She faces the ultimate challenge: to spend the night alone... with the spiders... in Spider House.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04mqc4z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04mqc4z&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nSpider House (90 minutes)\n \n\nMore Insects searh for\nInsects Slimoo\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Spider House.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 1.09 GB\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 28mn\nTotal bitrate               : 1 762 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : No\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 28mn\nBitrate                     : 1 562 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.209\nStream size                 : 993 MB (89%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 2\nCodec Id                    : 50\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 28mn\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 122 MB (11%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e08aaebd1dd4a07ab9c3df869477c69db86858","amp;dn":"Spider+House+-+Wildlife+-+Insects+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e08aaebd1dd4a07ab9c3df869477c69db86858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,224,138,174,189,29,212,160,122,185,195,223,134,148,119,198,157,184,104,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
