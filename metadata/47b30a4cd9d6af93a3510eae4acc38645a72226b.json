There was sometimes location shooting in San Diego, but other times it was obvious the navy yard backgrounds were unconvincing stock film footage.\n\nIt's kind of rare though not yet on DVD, so I don't have that many episodes. The ones I do have are all supposedly in the public domain.\n\nBefore James Komack became a TV producer / director he was a full-time actor, and in this series he had a recurring role in no less than 16 episodes as base dentist Lt. Harvey Spencer Blair.  This is Blair's second appearance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47b30a4cd9d6af93a3510eae4acc38645a72226b","amp;dn":"HENNESSEY+--+Harvey+Blair+Returns+%28+First+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47b30a4cd9d6af93a3510eae4acc38645a72226b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,179,10,76,217,214,175,147,163,81,14,174,74,204,56,100,90,114,34,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
