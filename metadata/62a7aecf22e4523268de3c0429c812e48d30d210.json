There they saw two aliens planting a bomb. The couple ran off - Catherine into the path of Straker's car, Tim, she understood to have fallen off a roof and died. However, he was taken by the aliens who took him over and is now back, looking no older than he did ten years ago and about to set off the bomb.\n\nFolks - This is the last UFO program. The series ran from 1969 to 1973 however there were only 26 episodes.\n\nI have a new series lined up to start next time. We still have quite a number of The Twilight Zones to go though.\n\nI hope you like the new one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a7aecf22e4523268de3c0429c812e48d30d210","amp;dn":"UFO+-+Ep.+26+The+Long+Sleep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a7aecf22e4523268de3c0429c812e48d30d210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,167,174,207,34,228,82,50,104,222,60,4,41,200,18,228,141,48,210,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
