Numerous antics follow, with Phillips getting Justice fixed up with the new prim-and-proper Matron (Joan Sims) and his attempted failures to lure the hospital's beauty, the physiotherapist\n\nMade 1966 in England at various locations.\n\nThis DVD is a direct copy using DVD Shrink, it maybe have been shrunk to fit a standard DVD (DVD5) \n\nI will only be able to seed on weekends and over night during the week.\n\nIf there are problems with this torrent please leave a comment and I will do what I can to fix the problem. Hey leave a comment anyway. A nice one would be good.\n\nOther uploads include:\n\nCoupling (A comedy series from England)\nWarehouse 13\nEureka (TV Series)\nMash (TV series)\n\nAll are direct DVD copies using dvd shrinkÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nI often see people complaining that downloads are slow, well one reason for that is that there are some people that just download and run. If you are anything like a decent person you will seed or upload the same amount or more that you have downloaded. Seeding or uploading will increase the upload speed.\n\nBe a decent person. \n\nAlso I see many people asking for more movie info.
