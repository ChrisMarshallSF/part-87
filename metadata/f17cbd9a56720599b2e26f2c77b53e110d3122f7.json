R. Panthulu. It features Sivaji Ganesan as the eponymous character, while N. T. Rama Rao, S. A. Asokan, R. Muthuraman, Devika, Savithri and M. V. Rajamma play supporting roles. The film is based on the story of Karna, a character from the Indian Hindu epic Mahabharata. He is born to an unmarried mother Kunti who sets him afloat in the Ganga river to avoid embarrassment. The child is discovered and adopted by a charioteer. Karnan does not want to follow his foster father's profession, and instead, becomes a warrior. He then befriends Duryodhana, the Kaurava prince, eventually setting the initial grounds of the Kurukshetra war, where he will join Duryodhana to fight against his own step brothers, the Pandavas.\n\nKarnan, which was officially launched in 1963, was Sivaji Ganesan's costliest production. It was the first Tamil film to be shot in the palaces of Jaipur and the war sequences were filmed in Kurukshetra, which featured several soldiers from the Indian Army. The film's original soundtrack was composed by M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy, while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The dialogues were written by Sakthi Krishnasamy, and the screenplay by A. S. Nagarajan. Karnan was considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of South Indian cinema, Sivaji Ganesan and N. T. Rama Rao.\n\nThe film was dubbed in Telugu as Karna, and also in Hindi as Dhaan Veer Karna. Karnan was released on 14 January 1964, during the festival occasion of Pongal, and received critical acclaim, with Ganesan and Rama Rao's performances being widely lauded. Despite this, it became a commercial failure, but ran for over 100 days in some theatres. The film also won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the 11th National Film Awards. A digitised version of Karnan released in March 2012, was well received commercially, eventually establishing a trend of re-releasing digitised versions of old films in Tamil cinema.\n\nCAST:-\nShivaji Ganesan...

The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan, who names him Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his foster father and feels heartbroken. He does not want to become a charioteer like his foster father, and chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.\n\nOne day, Indra, the king of Devas (celestial deities), disguised as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra. One day, a bee stings Karnan, but he endures it so as to not disturb his sleeping teacher. Parasurama however awakens and realises that Karnan is a Kshattriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he curses Karnan that he will not be able to use the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.\n\nKarnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot, and they fall in love. Subhangi's parents initially disapprove of their romance, but eventually they accept, and the couple get married. A few years later, Krishna, a supporter of the Pandavas, finds out about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first son whom she abandoned. Karnan gets to know about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra war, and that he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once. Karnan refuses to join his brothers, the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana. Before the start of the Kurukshetra war, DuryodhanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ministry assembles to appoint the generals of the army. Bheeshma is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bheeshma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjuna afterwards.\n\nThe next day, the vengeful Karnan uses the Nagastra to kill Arjuna, but Krishna saves Arjuna by preventing the arrow from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the Nagastra more than once, he is unable to kill Arjuna. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a big hole, and he steps down to relieve it. At that time, Arjuna, under the direction of Krishna, shoots many arrows at Karnan that severely wound him. Krishna tells Arjuna that the Dharma (noble charity) that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishna disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Out of generosity, Karnan donates all his virtues to the &quot;Brahmin&quot;. At this juncture, Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him. The Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother mourn his death. His mother Kunti also mourns his death, while Subhangi dies hearing her husband being killed in the war. Arjuna remorses killing Karnan, until Krishna reveals that the curses by Indra and Parasurama were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Sun in the other world.\n\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nKarnan was the first film to be shot at the Bangalore Palace.\n\nKarnan is based on the life of the character Karna from the Hindu epic Mahabharatha, and was officially launched in 1963 at Vijaya Studios in Chennai. B. R. Panthulu, who directed and produced the film under the banner Padmini Pictures, had &quot;based his screen play on traditional sources&quot; and collected most of his information from scholars Kripananda Variar and Anantarama Dikshitar. \nThe film's art work, one of the major highlights of the film, was led by Ganga, and the cinematography was handled by V. Ramamurthy. \nSivaji Ganesan was cast in the titular role, Telugu actor N. T. Rama Rao as Krishna, and R. Muthuraman as Arjuna. \nActresses Devika and Savitri were cast in the female lead roles, and S. A. Asokan as Karna's friend Duryodhana. \nThe role of Karna's mother was portrayed by M. V. Rajamma, and actress Sandhya played Karna's mother-in-law. \nOther supporting cast members included actor Shanmugasundaram as the charioteer Salliya Chakravarthy, V. S. Raghavan as Vidhuran, actresses Kalpana and Jayanthi, and a then six-year old &quot;Master&quot; Sridhar as the orphan Meghanathan. \nActor K. V. Srinivasan played a minor role as the sage who christens the lead character as Karnan. He also dubbed for the voice of Rama Rao, after Ganesan's insistence with Panthulu.\n\nKarnan was Sivaji Ganesan's most expensive epic film in his entire career and was considered to be &quot;one of the grandest and most expensive films of its times&quot;,with an estimated budget of INR4 million (valued at about US$840 000.84 in 1964).The high cost of the film was attributed to the transportation costs incurred to move chariots from Chennai to Kurukshetra, where the war sequences were filmed. Permission from the government was sought, cavalry and infantry from the Indian Army were brought to the locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers from the Indian Army. The battle scenes were shot with troupes of the 61 Cavalry Regiment, using 80 elephants, 400 horses and three cameras. Other scenes were shot at palaces in Jaipur.[20] Shooting for Karnan also took place at the Bangalore Palace in the Cantonment area, making it the first film to be shot there. In 2012, Panthulu's son Ravishankar revealed that a few shots involving Ganesan and Rama Rao took as many as four days to shoot, because of the large number of personnel involved. After the filming of Karnan was complete, all the chariots specially made for the war sequences in Kurukshetra, were donated to the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 3862 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: Tamil\nRunTime: 2:48:11\nSubtitles: English (only 90 mins)\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 2:48:11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17cbd9a56720599b2e26f2c77b53e110d3122f7","amp;dn":"Karnan+%281964%29+Tamil+MHCe+DVD5+-+Eng+Subs+-+Shivaji%2C+NTR%2C+Savitri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17cbd9a56720599b2e26f2c77b53e110d3122f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,124,189,154,86,114,5,153,178,226,111,44,119,181,62,17,13,49,34,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
