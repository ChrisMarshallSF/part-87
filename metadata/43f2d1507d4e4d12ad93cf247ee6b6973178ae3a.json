Sally Hyde (Jane Fonda) is volunteering at the Veterans' Hospital in Los Angeles while her husband Bob (Bruce Dern) serves in Vietnam. In the process of working in the hospital, Sally sees how the hospital is unprepared to treat the people who are coming back from the war. When paraplegic veteran Luke Martin (Jon Voight) demands better treatment, rather than listen to him, they tranquilize him so that they won't have to deal with him. Over time, Sally and Luke fall in love. When Bob returns from Vietnam, he is completely damaged emotionally. The final scene shows the overall state of the world as a result of the Vietnam War.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Coming.Home.1978.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 110 Kbps\nLength            : 5.46 GiB for 2h 7mn 56s 0ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 4 600 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 696 (1.839) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077362/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077362/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English (muxed) Portuguese (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f2d1507d4e4d12ad93cf247ee6b6973178ae3a","amp;dn":"Coming.Home.1978.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f2d1507d4e4d12ad93cf247ee6b6973178ae3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,242,209,80,125,78,77,18,173,147,207,36,126,230,182,151,49,120,174,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
