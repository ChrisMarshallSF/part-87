Detroit boasted the soul bashers but Chicago patented sweetness, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad that a label that had bunged a nickel in R&amp;B jukeboxes, hummed though doo-wop, doffed a halo to gospel, murmured approvingly to jazz, and was there at the start of soul didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite survive to meet the mass acceptance that black music won when the 60s matured. Anyway, with 10 CDs nestled in this box set, we can at least get the full picture of what Vee Jay had to offer over 13 packed years to 1966, and imagine what might have been had it managed to cling on to Joe Simon, The Dells, Betty Everett and the rest.\n\nThe first three CDs are dedicated to hits. These may include Frank IfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I Remember You, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost the only turkey in the henhouse. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usually a good sign when a compilation contains Dee ClarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tribute to Viagra, Just Keep It Up, and there he is: 23 tracks in out of an exhausting 269, and in good company. Eddie HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Exodus; Jimmy ReedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Big Boss Man (The StandellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cut is here too); Gene ChandlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Duke Of Earl; Billy Boy ArnoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got You; (Gladys Knight &amp; ) The Pips' Every Beat Of My Heart; John Lee HookerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Boom Boom; The DellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Oh What A NightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an embarrassment of riches.\n\nHowever, lest you think that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all one long knees-up, consider one Jerry Butler. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disturbing that even though Butler was so obvious an influence on Scott Walker (ButlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superior version of Make It Easy On Yourself is here), his name ranks low in the legend of Scott in comparison to Jaques Brel. Butler, the original lead singer in The Impressions, slipped into a dark mood in the first half of the 60s; a series of broken-hearted, world-weary performances climaxed in the tenement misery of I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To Hear [It] Anymore, one of the bleakest, grittiest records of the soul era, in which gossips mock him for being destroyed by love. Curtis Mayfield, an occasional vocal presence on back-up, provides a few songs: ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Temptation (Chandler) and Need To Belong (Butler); while Motown was knocking it out, Vee JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul was often troubled and thoughtful.\n\nMeanwhile, away from Vee JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartlands, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bump into British no-hopers The Beatles; The Four Seasons (Sherry, Big Girls DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Cry); Hoyt Axton (Double Double Dare); Mac Davis (Hey Monkey) and Shelley Fabares (Lost Summer Love) and Society Girls (SPCLG Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Society For The Prevention Of Cruelty To Little Girls, honestly). ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an entire CD of great gospel, another of jazz and more blues than you can shake your moneymaker at. Add a 72-page book, and this will keep you busy for 13 years. And beyond.  --Ian McCann, Record Collector Magazine\n\n\nAccording to the book accompanying this 10-disc tribute to the Chicago independent label, Ã¢â‚¬Å“in one month alone in 1964 Vee-Jay records sold 2.6 million records. Two years later the company was bankrupt.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The reason for it flying so high in 1964 was a deal made in 1962 when the label began licensing material from BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EMI. The prize then was yodelling popster Frank Ifield, whose Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Remember YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Vee-Jay got into the US Top 10. Along with Ifield, they got an unknown quantity called The Beatles. When 1964 arrived, Vee-Jay found it had a licence to print money.\n\nBut bills werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t paid. A move from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1963 took Vee-Jay away from its core market and the pool from which it drew talent. The label began falling apart in 1965, filed for bankruptcy in May 1966 with 64 lawsuits in the air and was wound up in August 1966.\n\nIt was a long way from the Chicago record store where the label was founded in July 1953. VivianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Record Shop was owned and run by DJ Vivian Carter and SmilinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jimmy Bracken Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their names were lent to the new label. Carter had an outlet to sell her releases, and an outlet to air them on the radio. Such interweaving strands were common with American independent labels, but Vee-Jay stood out as it was black-owned. Chess, ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other big indie, was white-owned. The lengthy in-depth essay in this packageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book draws a parallel with DetroitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Motown (as do the words &quot;hit factory&quot; in its title), but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overstating things a tad. Vee-Jay did not have one hit-making, constantly evolving sound or a visionary like Berry Gordy.\n\nChicago Hit Factory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Vee-Jay Story 1953-1966 Gene ChandlerBefore looking outside Chicago, Vee-Jay was the sound of the city: the roster had none of the acoustic blues, rockabilly and rockÃ¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll heard on the labels of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s south. Street-corner doo wop, metropolitan gospel, the electric blues of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s South Side and urban soul were Vee-JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meat and potatoes. In time, girl groups and country were also issued. Apart from their almost accidental snaring of the early Beatles catalogue, their biggest white chartbusters were The Four Seasons. Their prime black names were bluesman Jimmy Reed (their biggest long-term seller), soul stylist Jerry Butler and musical chameleon Gene Chandler (pictured left). National hits included The SpanielsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ evergreen Ã¢â‚¬Å“Goodnight, Sweetheart, GoodnightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1953), Jerry Butler &amp; the Impressions' Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Your Precious LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1958), Gene ChandlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duke of EarlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1961) and The Four SeasonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SherryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1962).\n\nAll these names and songs are amongst the whopping 269 tracks collected on Chicago Hit Factory. An impressive and keenly priced set, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a proper box with an old-fashioned lift-off lid and a stand-alone, well-illustrated floppy covered book. The pithily-told story doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shy away from Vee-JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lows but it does set the label in the context of the world it was operating in and the competition it faced.\n\nThe only possible conclusion to draw about Vee-Jay and its fate is that it had too few bankable artists and, as it developed, was too scattershot and did not focus on what it was best at. Releases by short-stay artists who had more success with other labels, like John Lee Hooker, Elmore James and Little Richard, were not going to ensure Vee-JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longevity. Hopping on the Phil Spector-girl group bandwagon, no matter how wonderful the results, was for the moment, not the future.\n\nNonetheless, it did issue amazing music from all the genres it dipped into. All strands of Vee-JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output are covered by the themed discs. The mid-Fifties Jimmy Reed and Billy Boy Arnold sides set the template for BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more questing early-Sixties R&amp;B bands. The doo wop tracks on disc four are spectral, swooning delights. The early soul of disc seven is often rough, but always infectious. Before losing its way as a result of the Beatles liaison, Vee-Jay was one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most vital labels. In telling it as it was, this box is a delight.  -- Kieron Tyler, The Arts Desk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf49341ed1849529d3847bd869c674d6e5a7673","amp;dn":"VA+-+Chicago+Hit+Factory%3A++The+Vee+Jay+Story+1953-1966+10+Disc+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf49341ed1849529d3847bd869c674d6e5a7673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,244,147,65,237,24,73,82,157,56,71,189,134,156,103,77,110,90,118,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
