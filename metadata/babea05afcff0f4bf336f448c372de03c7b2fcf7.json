It is the band's nineteenth single and the third from their Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album. The single, which was also released as a clear vinyl, debuted at number six in the UK charts. It contains three live performances from Maiden's 1988 headlining performance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Donington Park.\n\nThe promotional video for the song, although set to the studio version, features live clips from the Donington performance.\n\nThe song starts in the first person, from the main character's point of view. Later, it's in the third person, after he's dead. According to Steve Harris, the song was inspired by the death of psychic Doris Stokes, and his wondering that if she were truly able to see the future, wouldn't she have been able to foresee her own death?\n\nThe song's guitar solo is played by Dave Murray.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; (live) (Steve Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n    &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (live) (Adrian Smith; Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:07\n    &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (live) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babea05afcff0f4bf336f448c372de03c7b2fcf7","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+The+Clairvoyant+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babea05afcff0f4bf336f448c372de03c7b2fcf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,190,160,90,252,255,15,75,243,54,244,72,195,114,222,3,199,178,252,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
