But this is also the story of a controversy that has lasted almost 70 years.\n\nThe programme covers six years of wartime operations, and traces the obstacles and challenges that were overcome as the RAF developed and deployed the awesome fighting force that was Bomber Command","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ba3ad581ae6f5bd76afd6c569af9b6e0c612a9","amp;dn":"Bomber.Boys.2012.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ba3ad581ae6f5bd76afd6c569af9b6e0c612a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,186,58,213,129,174,111,91,215,106,253,108,86,154,249,182,224,198,18,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
