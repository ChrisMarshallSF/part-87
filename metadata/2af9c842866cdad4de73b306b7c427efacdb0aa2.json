The sub-rattling and operatic opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to Kill God,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a scathing indictment of major religions and the transgressions enacted in their name, serves as a statement of purpose. No Ã¢â‚¬Å“ismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is out of bounds, no topic too untoward. Whatever you hold sacred isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t above aggressive inquiry.\n\nBehind the boards, Apollo Brown orchestrates with divine aural vision. ThoughBlasphemy is his first album with a west coast rapper, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t retread g-funk synth grooves. He also forgoes the minimal, rubbery bounce popular with the current crop of west coast talent. Amidst a sea of production crafted for the drug-addled turn up, his work is a life preserver, saving ardent hip-hop fans with hard-hitting beats made buoyant by donuts of soul and blues. On his deftly layered suites, drums hit with the force of an unabridged Bible to the dome, the samples masterfully selected and utilized. WithBlasphemy, Brown has created MPC gospel, sonic scripture.\n\nIn his seminal memoir Soul on Ice, Eldridge Cleaver wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the gods are dead except the god of war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ever since Ras Kass titled his 1996 opening salvo after CleaverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, the critically revered Carson, CA rapper has waged verbal warfare against all those with aims of obscuring the truth. Rappers, preachers, politicians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ none have been spared from the wrath of his sharp, illuminating rhymes.\n\nWhen not eviscerating MCs and poking holes in theologies, Ras Kass surrounds himself with a rogueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gallery of decorated veterans. Pharoahe Monch, Rakaa Iriscience, Xzibit, and Royce Da 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢9Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are among the handful of the elite lyricists present. Each delivers their singular bars in top form, making the songs on which they appear some of the best posse cuts youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear in 2014.\n\nAbove all, this album displays Apollo Brown &amp; Ras KassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ undeniable synergy. Their sacred writ is the same, their blasphemy for those who want to think as they nod to the rhythm. When Ras Kass crucifies supposed facts over ApolloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beats, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear he is the West CoastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preeminent philosopher. When ApolloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blaring suites soothe your soul, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an ontological fact that he ranks among the best producers in the game. With Blasphemy, the duo has delivered the truth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af9c842866cdad4de73b306b7c427efacdb0aa2","amp;dn":"Apollo+Brown+%26amp%3B+Ras+Kass+-+Blasphemy+%5B2014%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af9c842866cdad4de73b306b7c427efacdb0aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,249,200,66,134,108,218,212,222,115,179,6,183,196,39,239,172,219,10,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
