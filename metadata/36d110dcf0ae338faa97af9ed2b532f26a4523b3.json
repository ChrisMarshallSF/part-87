However Olivier was already committed to the project The Beggar's Opera (1953). Leigh was enthusiastic about the role and continued in her husband's absence, but she was forced to withdraw from production shortly after filming began in Colombo, Ceylon, as a result of bipolar disorder. According to Leonard Maltin's annual Movie Guide book, Leigh can be seen in some long shots that were not re-filmed after Elizabeth Taylor replaced her.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Elizabeth Taylor as Ruth Wiley\n    Dana Andrews as Dick Carver, the manager of the plantation\n    Peter Finch as John Wiley, Ruth's husband\n    Abraham Sofaer as Appuhamy, handyman of John's father Tom\n    Noel Drayton as Chief Planter Atkinson\n    Abner Biberman as Doctor Pereira\n    Rosalind Ivan as Mrs. Lakin\n    Edward Ashley-Cooper as Planter Gordon Gregory\n    Barry Bernard as Planter Strawson\n    Philip Tonge as Planter John Ralph\n    Leo Britt as Planter Chisholm\n    Mylee Haulani as Rayna\n\nDirected by William Dieterle\nProduced by Irving Asher\nMusic by Franz Waxman\nRunning time 103 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Elephant Walk (1954)\nColonial tea planter John Wiley, visiting England at the end of World War II, wins and weds lovely English rose Ruth and takes her home to Elephant Walk, Ceylon, where the local elephants have a grudge against the plantation because it blocks their migrating path. Ruth's delight with the tropical wealth and luxury of her new home is tempered by isolation as the only white woman in the district; by her husband's occasional imperious arrogance; by a mutual physical attraction with plantation manager Dick Carver; and by the hovering, ominous menace of the hostile elephants. The elephants end up destroying the plantation in a stampede along with a fire.\n\nMaltin gave the film 2 stars out of 4, and made one of his pithier critiques: &quot;Pachyderm stampede climax comes none too soon.&quot; A major plot element in the film is that the tea plantation's manor, where the film's action occurs, had been built in the middle of a path that migrating Indian elephants had previously used.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 5519 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 103 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d110dcf0ae338faa97af9ed2b532f26a4523b3","amp;dn":"Elephant+Walk+%281954%29+DVD5+Untouched+-+Elizabeth+Taylor%2C+Dana+And","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d110dcf0ae338faa97af9ed2b532f26a4523b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,209,16,220,240,174,51,143,170,151,175,158,210,181,50,242,106,69,35,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
