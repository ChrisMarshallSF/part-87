Things look even worse when thuggish Met officers lean on Bacchus to betray his boss, claiming that Gently murdered an undercover cop infiltrating local gangs. Bacchus begins to doubt their claims and Gently has further allies in retired cop Don McGhee and lawyer Gitta Bronson but, following an attempt on his life, goes on the run, being saved by Bacchus when corrupt officers pursue him to a remote farm-house to kill him. He is wounded and helped by Gitta before facing a showdown in Durham cathedral with the person who really framed him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:300a3934d5b4c2dedd3398372e1ba7a9866045cb","amp;dn":"George.Gently.S05E04.Gently.in.the.Cathedral.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"300a3934d5b4c2dedd3398372e1ba7a9866045cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,10,57,52,213,180,194,222,221,51,152,55,46,27,167,169,134,96,69,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
