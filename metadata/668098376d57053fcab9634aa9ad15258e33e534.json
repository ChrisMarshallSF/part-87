Mrs Dunwoody, the owner, tells them that Faith had a twin brother and the mother Susan Faulkner disappeared with him after Faith's adoption but, when traced, Susan is unable to help the enquiry. After a kidnap ransom demand proves to be a red herring Gently discovers that both Frances and Stephen have guilty secrets from the past, which, in one case, will solve the case.
