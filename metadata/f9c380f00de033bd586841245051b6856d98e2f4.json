A host of other Fax favorites make appearances: Plastikman's Richie Hawtin on the epic From Within track &quot;Sad Alliance,&quot; Deep Space Network and Dr. Atmo on I.F.'s &quot;Kisy Loa,&quot; Atom Heart and Tetsu Inoue on their Datacide track &quot;Data Haku.&quot; Fax is easily the most traditional-sounding ambient label, and the music would make an equally strong impression on fans of Hearts of Space and Basic Channel.\n\n\nCD 1 Tracklist:\n01.
