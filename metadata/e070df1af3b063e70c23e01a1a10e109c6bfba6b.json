Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e070df1af3b063e70c23e01a1a10e109c6bfba6b","amp;dn":"HandsOnHardcore+Lea+Lexis+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e070df1af3b063e70c23e01a1a10e109c6bfba6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,112,223,26,243,176,99,231,12,35,224,26,26,16,225,9,198,191,186,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
