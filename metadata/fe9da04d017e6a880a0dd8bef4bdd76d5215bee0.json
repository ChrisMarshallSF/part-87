This reference offers an in-depth explanation of the degradation process, mechanisms, and control factors affecting each method, as well as issues crucial to the application of these approaches in real-world treatment sites. It examines ten of the most common and useful chemical technologies for environmental remediation and sanitation of industrial waste streams and offers implementation guidelines and examples of remediation strategies that are crucial to effective wastewater cleansing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9da04d017e6a880a0dd8bef4bdd76d5215bee0","amp;dn":"Chemical+Degradation+Methods+for+Wastes+and+Pollutants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9da04d017e6a880a0dd8bef4bdd76d5215bee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,157,160,77,1,126,106,136,10,13,216,190,244,189,215,109,82,21,190,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
