While not labelled &quot;best of&quot; it is a collection of songs taken from other releases as the title states. A nice soothing mix.\n\nNow for some education, the rip accuracy data (log) is in each track. Older methods that only generate the log as a stand-alone file are nice, but lack MP3 tagging. \n\nNo matter where a Big Papi track goes that track tells its own story since the story is embedded in the MP3 tags.  This is essential since Big Papi rips from actual compact discs for archiving.\n\nPeace and love and thanks for seeding. Getting the music uploaded is a small part of being a pirate. Seeding it keeps it alive. You are the real heroes.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/632a22fb9a5383ec0cd9076b3ecf128b051b9c10.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n George Winston - Selections from Other Recordings (D116471)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: George Winston\nAlbum................: Selections from Other Recordings (D116471)\nGenre................: New Age\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 41 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
