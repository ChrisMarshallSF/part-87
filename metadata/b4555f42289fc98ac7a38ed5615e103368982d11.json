Their journey will take them through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, as well as a mysterious and sinister figure known only as the Necromancer. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the Goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever...Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage, he also gains possession of Gollum's &quot;precious&quot; ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.\n\n\n- Audio:\n\nEnglish (AAC, 6 channels)\nPortuguese BR (AAC, 2 channels)\n\n\n\n- Subtitle:\n\nEnglish\nPortuguese BR\nSpanish\nFrench\n\n\n\nTHE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG [EXTENDED] (2014)\n\n\n- Description:\n\nAcademy AwardÃ‚Â® winner Peter Jackson continues his Middle-Earth saga that follows the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) who's swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug.
