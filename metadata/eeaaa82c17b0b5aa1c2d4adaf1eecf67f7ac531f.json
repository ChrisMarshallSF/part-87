A fan of classic horror stories, Joy is convinced that famous author E. A. Peugeot based his spine-tingling tales on Spooking. Take the eerie similarities between the nearby swamp and the setting of his masterpiece, &quot;The Bawl of the Bog Fiend.&quot; Could the story be true? Could the bog fiend be on the loose?\n\nThings become truly horrifying when Joy learns that Darlington, the despicable suburban city where she is forced to go to school, is planning to build a water park over her beloved bog. It is up to her to safeguard the endangered area and its secrets. Little does she know that there is someone determined to destroy not only the bog but the town of Spooking itself -- and anyone who dares stand in his way.\n\nP. J. Bracegirdle spins a yarn of delicious devilry and macabre mayhem in the very first book of The Joy of Spooking trilogy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeaaa82c17b0b5aa1c2d4adaf1eecf67f7ac531f","amp;dn":"Fiendish+Deeds+by+P.J.+Bracegirdle+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeaaa82c17b0b5aa1c2d4adaf1eecf67f7ac531f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,170,168,44,23,176,181,170,28,45,74,218,241,238,207,103,247,172,83,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
