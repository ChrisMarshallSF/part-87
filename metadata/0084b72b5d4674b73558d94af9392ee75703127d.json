A year has passed since Sword Art Online (SAO) was cleared. [Kirito] is asked by [Kikuoka] to investigate Gun Gale Online, specifically Death Gun, a weapon which seemed to link deaths in the virtual reality world to those in the real world. Upon entering the game, [Kirito] meets [Sinon] who teaches him the ropes of the game. They both enter the Gun Gale Online tournament, Bullet of Bullets. Kirito displays his amazing skills although he is only a newcomer to the game. Later, Kirito finds out that the mysterious deaths are linked to a red guild named Laughing Coffin in SAO. \n\nSource: SAO \n\nWikia Note: The first episode received advance premiere screening on June 29, 2014.
