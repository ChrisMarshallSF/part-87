It was published by Shogakukan in their Big Comic Original magazine between 1994 and 2001, with the chapters collected and reprinted into 18 tankÃ…ï¿½bon volumes. The story revolves around KenzÃ…ï¿½ Tenma, a Japanese surgeon living in Germany whose life enters turmoil after getting himself involved with Johan Liebert, one of his former patients who is revealed to be a dangerous psychopath.\n\nUrasawa later wrote and illustrated the novel Another Monster, a story detailing the events of the manga from an investigative reporter's point of view, which was published in 2002. The manga was adapted by Madhouse into a 74-episode anime TV series, which aired on NTV from April 2004 to September 2005. It was directed by Masayuki Kojima, written by Tatsuhiko Urahata and featured character design by KitarÃ…ï¿½ KÃ…ï¿½saka. The manga and anime have both been licensed by Viz Media for English releases in North America, with the anime having been broadcast on several television channels. In 2013, Siren Visual licensed the anime for Australasia. Monster has been critically acclaimed, with the manga having won several awards and its anime adaptation being called one of the best of the decade.\n\n[PLOT - SPOILER ALERT]\n\nDr. KenzÃ…ï¿½ Tenma is a young Japanese doctor, working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in DÃƒÂ¼sseldorf in 1986. An accomplished brain surgeon, he seems to have everything: a soon-to-be promotion; the favor of the hospital's director, Udo Heinemann; and Heinemann's daughter Eva as his fiancÃƒÂ©e. However, Tenma is increasingly dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change things after a massacre brings fraternal twins Johan and Anna Liebert into the hospital. Tenma, going by his ethics as a doctor, decides to operate on Johan instead of the mayor of DÃƒÂ¼sseldorf, who arrived later. Johan is saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies. Tenma loses his social standing (and Eva) as a result, but comforts himself by believing he did the right thing and despairs of ever achieving his earlier high goals. However, Director Heinemann and the other doctors in Tenma's way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital soon afterwards. The police suspect Tenma, since he benefits from the unfortunate turn of events; however, they have no evidence and can only question him.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. A patient of his, being questioned in connection with the murder of middle-aged couples across Germany, is murdered in front of his eyes, and the killer is revealed to be Johan Liebert, the child who disappeared. Tenma tells all to the police, but they find no trace of anyone named Johan Liebert, and Tenma soon becomes the lead suspect. Distraught that what he believed was the right thing has actually led to so much misery, Tenma begins to track down Johan, wanting to hunt the Monster down as atonement for his fatal mistake.\n\nTenma's hunt for Johan brings him face to face with the dingy, unpleasant underbelly of the world, from politics to organized crime, from serial killers to innocent orphans, a showcasing of how a man can turn himself into a force of evil, of how easy it is to destroy the fragile balance of life, and how frightening the unknown can be. Tenma must piece together the few hints he can find to catch Johan, but this surely is no game of cat &amp; mouse, it is one determined man's struggle against something much greater, something that might have been designed to be much greater. But Tenma is not alone, even as Johan leaves destruction in his wake, Tenma is closing in, the question which he has to ask of himself is that, knowing what he knows, can he still claim to know who the Monster is, can he ever win his struggle against this evil of near-mythical proportions?\n\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\n\nVideo &amp; Source: DVD\nAudio Source: DVD\n\nFile Container: MKV\nVideo Format: h.265/HEVC\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\n\nAudio Type: 2 Channel Stereo\nTrack 1: English\nTrack 2: Japanese\nAudio Format: AAC\n\nSubtitle Language: English\nSubtitle Format: Mixture of SSA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2db79fc4bdffe6f604c2dddfc62f5fd3e11685f","amp;dn":"Monster+%28The+Complete+Anime+Series%29+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D+%5B480p%5D+%5BHEVC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2db79fc4bdffe6f604c2dddfc62f5fd3e11685f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,219,121,252,75,223,254,111,96,76,45,221,252,98,245,253,62,17,104,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
