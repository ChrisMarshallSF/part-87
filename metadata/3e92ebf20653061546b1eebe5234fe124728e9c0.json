Once the capability of tapping into &quot;higher brain functions&quot; is added in, and you can literally jump into someone else's head and play back recordings of what he or she was thinking, feeling, seeing, etc., at the time of the recording, the applications for the project quickly spiral out of control. While Michael Brace uses the system to become close again to Karen Brace, his estranged wife who also works on the project, others start abusing it for intense sexual experiences and other logical but morally questionable purposes. The government tries to kick Michael and Lillian off the project once the vast military potential of the technology is discovered. It soon becomes obvious that the government is interested in more than just missile guidance systems. The lab starts producing mind torture recordings and other psychosis inducing material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e92ebf20653061546b1eebe5234fe124728e9c0","amp;dn":"Brainstorm+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e92ebf20653061546b1eebe5234fe124728e9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,146,235,242,6,83,6,21,70,177,238,190,82,52,254,18,71,40,233,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
