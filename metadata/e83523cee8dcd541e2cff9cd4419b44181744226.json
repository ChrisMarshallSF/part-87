Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn agreed to allow Novak to appear in Vertigo as a last-minute replacement for pregnant Vera Miles, so long as Stewart appeared in this film with Novak. The supporting cast includes Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs.\n\nThe original 1950 play starred Rex Harrison, his then-wife Lilli Palmer, Jean Adair and Larry Gates. The play is set entirely in the Holroyd residence and is written for a cast of five. The additional characters that appear in the film are only mentioned by name in the play.\n\n\nThis is mp4 and should play on all PS3s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83523cee8dcd541e2cff9cd4419b44181744226","amp;dn":"Bell%2C+Book+and+Candle+%281957%29+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83523cee8dcd541e2cff9cd4419b44181744226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,53,35,206,232,220,213,65,226,207,249,205,68,25,180,65,129,116,66,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
