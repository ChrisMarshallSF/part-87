In 1927, RenÃƒÂ© GuÃƒÂ©non responded to this crisis with the closest thing he ever wrote to a manifesto and 'call-to-action'. The Crisis of the Modern World was his most direct and complete application of traditional metaphysical principles-particularly that of the 'age of darkness' preceding the end of the present world-to social criticism, surpassed only by The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, his magnum opus. In the present work GuÃƒÂ©non ruthlessly exposes the 'Western deviation': its loss of tradition, its exaltation of action over knowledge, its rampant individualism and general social chaos. His response to these conditions was not 'activist', however, but purely intellectual, envisioning the coming together of Western intellectual leaders capable under favorable circumstances of returning the West to its traditional roots, most likely via the Catholic Church, or, under less favorable ones, of at least preserving the 'seeds' of Tradition for the time to come.\n\nMake sure your guns are loaded.The niggers are going to riot and it will be open season on the coons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a2afa59c855a4bcc7fad1ac85898376cc707f5","amp;dn":"The+Crisis+of+the+Modern+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a2afa59c855a4bcc7fad1ac85898376cc707f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,162,175,165,156,133,90,75,204,127,173,26,200,88,152,55,108,199,7,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
