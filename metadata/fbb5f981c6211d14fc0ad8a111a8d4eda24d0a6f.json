After self-releasing their EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Awakening VesuviusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2004, they recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lay Waste the PoetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, their first full length, in 2005 for Facedown Records. The lead single from that album was picked up by MtvÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HeadbangersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ball and after touring extensively to promote Ã¢â‚¬Å“PoetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Inked In Blood would seclude themselves within the confines of the Spectre Studios compound to work with Troy Glessner on a new album. The result was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes We Are BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a 2007 record that was heavier and more melodic than any of their previous works. The hooks were founded on addictive melodies and singable choruses; in fact Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes We Are BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was rooted firmly in the tradition of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœevolving hardcoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ where the energy, intelligence and beauty of a bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound reflected the current state of the scene. In 2008 Inked In Blood disbanded saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“The good times were more than good. They were life-changing, and the most precious weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever had.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n    Metalcore \n\nStatus \tFormed In\tSeparated In\nSplit-Up\t2002\t2009\nCountry\n\n    USA \n\nLast line-up\n\tOthers bands/comments\nBlake Hooper\n: Guitar \t\nJustin Salinas\n: Drums \tThe Word Alive, ex-Mychildren Mybride, ex-Scars Of Tomorrow\nChris Esinoza\n: Bass \t\nJoey Trump\n: Vocals \t\nMatt McDonnell\n: Guitar \t\nPast members\n\tOthers bands/comments\nSteven Gosvener : Bass \t\nKelly James Mullinix : Guitar \t\nStephen Poole : Drums \tThe Arson Portrait, Color Of A Casualty\t\n\nAlbum\nAwakening Vesuvius (EP -\n2003\n\t\n\n1\n\t\nDead Men Rule Nothing\n\t\n3:05\n2\n\t\nThe Cosmos in a Box\n\t\n4:07\n3\n\t\nMoments and Possibilities\n\t\n2:21\n4\n\t\nWhere the Enemy Sleeps\n\t\n4:19\n5\n\t\nThe New Empiricism\n\t\n5:12","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb5f981c6211d14fc0ad8a111a8d4eda24d0a6f","amp;dn":"+Inked+In+Blood+-Awakening+Vesuvius+%28EP%29+-+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb5f981c6211d14fc0ad8a111a8d4eda24d0a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,181,249,129,198,33,29,20,252,10,216,161,17,168,212,237,162,77,10,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
