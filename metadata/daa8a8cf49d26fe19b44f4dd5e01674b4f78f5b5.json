And a SPEK sample image to show the final spectrum of the WAV file (I didnt put the M4A spectrum image because of the little difference).\n\nÃ‚Â·You can check and comment, of course.\n\nÃ‚Â·Also i put the gain of the FLAC versiÃƒÂ³n +0.5 db to equal the MP3 level, but that didnt distort anything as the FLAC versiÃƒÂ³n was less higher.\n\nÃ‚Â·Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa8a8cf49d26fe19b44f4dd5e01674b4f78f5b5","amp;dn":"Some+Chords+%28Dillon+Francis+Remix%29+%5BOriginal+F%2A%2Ak+sample%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa8a8cf49d26fe19b44f4dd5e01674b4f78f5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,168,168,207,73,210,111,225,155,68,244,221,94,1,103,75,79,120,245,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
