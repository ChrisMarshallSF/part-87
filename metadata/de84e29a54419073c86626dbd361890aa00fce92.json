It has a similar interface to GNU tar. Instead of doing\n\ntar -xvf archive.tar,\n\njust do\n\nunnks -xvf archive.nks,\n\nor optionally\n\nunnks -C output_dir -xvf archive.nks.\n\nIn addition to the unnks program, this package contains the utilities nks-scan, nks-ls-libs, and the libnks library.\n\nnks-scan can be used to display the structure of a nks/nkx archive. It was used during development to discover the meaning of unknown bytes in archives.\n\nnks-ls-libs displays all the sample packages you have installed on your computer that it can find, and their nkx archive encryption keys. It is only present on Windows and Mac OS X. See the &quot;nkx support&quot; section for how to use this tool to add support for more nkx archives to unnks.\n\nlibnks is a library useful to programmers, which provides an interface to the code that unnks uses internally to access archives. If you want to add nks/nkx support to your GPLv3+ program, then you may use libnks to accomplish it. Be warned however, that the API/ABI may change in future releases without warning.\n\nnkx support\n\nnkx files are different from nks files in that each archive may have its own encryption key needed to extract the contents. These keys are usually supplied as part of the package containing the archives, but the exact location may vary and is dependant on the host operating system: on Windows, the keys may be kept in the registry, on Mac OS X in application property files. There is no universal and platform-independent way of accessing these. This is why unnks contains a database of known packages with nkx archives and how to obtain their keys. Currently, archives from the following packages are supported:\n\nAcoustic Legends HD\nAmbience Impacts Rhythms\nBASiS\nChris Hein Bass\nChris Hein - Guitars\nChris Hein Horns Vol 2\nDrums Overkill\nEthno World 4\nEvolve\nEvolve Mutations\nGalaxy II\nGarritan Instruments for Finale\nGofriller Cello\nKeyboard Collection\nKreate\nMixosaurus Kit A\nMojo Horn Section\nMr. Sax T\nOcean Way Drums Expandable\nOcean Way Drums Gold\nOTTO\nPhaedra\nProminy SC Electric Guitar\nSolo Strings Advanced\nSteven Slate Drums EX\nSteven Slate Drums Platinum\nStradivari Solo Violin\nString Essentials\nSymphobia\nsyntAX\nThe Elements\nThe Trumpet\nVI.ONE\nVir2 Elite Orchestral Percussion\nIf you want to unpack an unsupported nkx archive, you may try to use the nks-ls-libs tool supplied with unnks to list the packages installed on your computer, along with their nkx archive encryption keys. If you then email this information to unavowed at vexillium org, it will be included in the next version of unnks.\n\nLimitations\n\nOnly extracting or listing archives is supported; unnks does not create new archives.\nThe archives to be extracted must be seekable files. Extracting from stdin or other non-seekable streams is not supported.\nThanks\n\nThanks to Gynvael Coldwind for pointing out bugs in the code, and to Steffan Andrews for all the help with discovering how to extract nkx files and then testing whether it actually worked.\n\nAlso thanks to all those who reported bugs, sent encryption key information and in general sent emails about this project","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de84e29a54419073c86626dbd361890aa00fce92","amp;dn":"unnks+0.2.5+nks+and+nkx+archive+unpacker+-+unavowed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de84e29a54419073c86626dbd361890aa00fce92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,132,226,154,84,65,144,115,200,102,38,219,211,97,137,10,160,15,206,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
