In total, there are 23 nested levels of compression in the hierarchy (including the first and last). \n\nThis was just meant for fun; idk why I did it. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9e69f7b6845eed003dfc3ab6edd48f2de90e6a","amp;dn":"1208925820000+Yottabyte+%28YB%2FYiB%29+Zip+Bomb%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9e69f7b6845eed003dfc3ab6edd48f2de90e6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,158,105,247,182,132,94,237,0,61,252,58,182,237,212,143,45,233,14,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
