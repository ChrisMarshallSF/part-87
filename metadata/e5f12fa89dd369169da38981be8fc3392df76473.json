A top-scoring striker with Paris Saint-Germain and captain of the Swedish national team, he has dominated the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most storied teams, including Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, and AC Milan. But his life wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always so charmed.\n \nBorn to Balkan immigrants who divorced when he was a toddler, Zlatan learned self-reliance from his rough-and-tumble neighborhood. While his father, a Bosnian Muslim, drank to forget the war back home, his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s household was engulfed in chaos. Soccer was ZlatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release. Mixing in street moves and trick plays, Zlatan was a wild talent who rode to practice on stolen bikes and relished showing up the rich kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€opponents and teammates alike. Goal by astonishing goal, the brash young outsider grew into an unlikely prodigy and, by his early twenties, an international phenomenon.\n \nTold as only the man himself could tell it, featuring stories of friendships and feuds with the biggest names in the sport, I Am Zlatan is a wrenching, uproarious, and ultimately redemptive tale for underdogs everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, seed\n\nPLEASE COMMENT IT LETS ME KNOW THAT I HELPED A GUY OUT!!!\n\nCHEERS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f12fa89dd369169da38981be8fc3392df76473","amp;dn":"I+Am+Zlatan%3A+My+Story+On+and+Off+the+Field+2014+epub+and+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f12fa89dd369169da38981be8fc3392df76473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,241,47,168,157,211,105,22,157,163,137,129,190,143,195,57,45,247,100,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
