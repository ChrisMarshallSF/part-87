Clearly I dont tape things \n   too often off tv but here it is finally! :)\n\n \n   This is the 2nd movie they have made on Terry Fox's life. This one doesnt portray\n   Terry as mean as the first one did. ha. I think they are both good movies \n   but this one is more modern and all that.\n\n\n   taped in SP (2 hour mode) off my standalone Magnavox Dvd recorder. It does a good job!\n \n   Running Time: 1hour 27min 22seconds (i paused out the commercials)\n\n\n   \n   enjoy and seed anywhere and everywhere! \n\n   keep sharing!!! \n\n\n   \n   720 x 480 resolution (dvd quality)\n   256 kb/s AC3 audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9fa6ea0cf1235ade9394f5ca579b9b99fa184c1","amp;dn":"Terry+2005+%28Terry+Fox+Movie%29+Dvd+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9fa6ea0cf1235ade9394f5ca579b9b99fa184c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,250,110,160,207,18,53,173,233,57,79,92,165,121,185,185,159,161,132,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
