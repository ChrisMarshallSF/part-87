To commemorate what would have been RaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 100th birthday, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve teamed up with Art Yard for a very special release. In The Orbit Of Ra is a new collection presented by the longest serving member of the Arkestra and current bandleader, Marshall Allen. Bringing together Sun Ra highights from over 25 years of music, the album is the first internationally released compilation to provide an introduction to the music of Sun Ra, all mastered from the original tapes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fe204f08694513faadb85337f70c3fb8755078","amp;dn":"Sun+Ra+%26amp%3B+His+Arkestra+-+In+the+Orbit+of+Ra+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fe204f08694513faadb85337f70c3fb8755078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,254,32,79,8,105,69,19,250,173,184,83,55,247,12,63,184,117,80,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
