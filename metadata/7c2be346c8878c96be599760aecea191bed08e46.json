The story was of the 1984 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro by Palestinian terrorists and their eventual murdering of one of the passengers, a retired, wheelchair-bound American Jew named Leon Klinghoffer. People who dismissed Nixon in China as a farce or as an operatic version of Pop Art were even faster to prejudge The Death of Klinghoffer as a hectic attempt to cash in on a garish and ghoulish public event in hopes of getting the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immediate attention. The term &quot;docu-opera&quot; began to stick to these pieces like a burr. The Death of Klinghoffer started eliciting opinions even before a note of it had been heard outside my studio.\n\nAlice GoodmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second libretto was disturbing for many, not only because the clarity and simplicity of her Nixon in China libretto had given way to a rhythm and utterance that echoed in density and depth the Koran and the Old Testament, but also because in her text, she gave voice to the sufferings of both Jews and Palestinians. The very words of the Exiled Palestinians that open the opera were to some listeners not a simple statement of fact, but rather a provocation.\n\nMy fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house was razed\nIn nineteen forty-eight\nWhen the Israelis\nPassed over our street\n\nThe Nixon/Mao encounter, puffed up and media-driven as it was, lent itself perfectly to a parody in the Verdian verismo style. The models for The Death of Klinghoffer , on the other hand, were the Bach Passions: grave, symbolic, narrative poems, supported by large choral pillars. The hijacking itself is portrayed in all its terror and pandemonium. Then follows a long, ruminative scene, a nocturnal dialogue worthy of a Joseph Conrad tale, during which one of the terrorists, Mamoud, has a long dialogue with the ship captain, recounting his childhood in a refugee camp and the violence that has permeated his every waking moment.\n\nThe second act opens with a choral retelling of the story of Hagar and the Angel, which in the original production became the source for one of Mark MorrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most brilliant choreographic narratives. Then follows the rapid unraveling of the terrorists plans and the inexplicable decision to execute Klinghoffer. No one knows why this particular man was singled out for execution. Was he simply a sacrificial lamb in a terrorist scenario gone awry? Had he, through some exchange of words, prompted his own demise? Or was he, simply because of his handicap, an encumbrance? In a scene for Leon Klinghoffer and the terrorist whom all the hostages dubbed &quot;Rambo&quot; the desperation of a conflict that refuses to be healed is summed up in a blistering exchange of accusations, vicious clichÃƒÂ©, and degradation. .\n\nThe Death of Klinghoffer opened in Brussels in March of 1991, just as the Gulf War was winding down. Like the Nixon in China premiere, it attracted an inordinate amount of press, but the actual response to the performances was muted, possibly let down by the fact that the work itself, far from being a graphic exploitations of a terrorist episode, turned out to be a ceremony of almost Attic formality, complete with choreography and highly ritualized physical gestures. It was a difficult work, complex and emotionally wrenching, and its reception and appreciation was further compromised by the highly charged nature of its subject. When the opera reached the U.S. in the autumn of 1991, the public response was extreme. More than a few reviews ridiculed its political &quot;naÃƒÂ¯vetÃƒÂ©,&quot; and almost all found significant fault with its artistic merit. The libretto was clumsy and fashionably &quot;politically correct;&quot; the music was &quot;bland, derivative, ineffective&quot;. When The Death of Klinghoffer played six performances at the San Francisco Opera in the fall of 1992, it was the second most attended opera of their season, and each performance was picketed by a Jewish information group who also wrote letters of condemnation to the local press. Shortly after, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, one of the workÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s co-commissioners, cancelled its planned series of performances without any explanation. Since then the opera has not been produced in an American opera house.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Klinghoffer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Klinghoffer&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/arts/music/john-adams-death-of-klinghoffer-metropolitan-opera-debut.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/arts/music/john-adams-death-of-klinghoffer-metropolitan-opera-debut.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese are lossless .ape files.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://xact.scottcbrown.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://xact.scottcbrown.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2be346c8878c96be599760aecea191bed08e46","amp;dn":"John+Adams+-+The+Death+of+Klinghoffer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2be346c8878c96be599760aecea191bed08e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,43,227,70,200,135,140,150,190,89,151,96,174,206,161,145,190,208,142,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
