Ant then gets into past girlfriends and what future ones can expect, going through peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phones, and engages in some caller Russian roulette. We get a recap of Al SharptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 60th birthday bash, talk about Montel Williams, and are treated to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Throwback Thursday.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He goes through un-PC commercials from the past, we watch a PSA from Canada, and Ticket University helps another lucky soul to be unblocked. We see a terrible viral video, learn about Oculus Rift, get an update on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sperm woman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ watch some roller coaster videos, and yay, we hear from more callers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3191f6e68f0b7ac6e93d37332976daa2c4d22443","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-02+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3191f6e68f0b7ac6e93d37332976daa2c4d22443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,145,246,230,143,11,122,198,233,61,55,51,41,118,218,162,196,210,36,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
