Recorded in a basement, hear the elegant weavings of distorted guitars, steel guitars, and piano into a reverie of sadness. This rare album took me forever to find. It is by far one of my favourite Richard Edwards' album.\n\nTRACK LISTING\n1. Open Your Eyes\n2. Butterball\n3. Jolene, We Almost Never Met\n4. Smile At Me\n5. Kim\n6. Piglet\n7.
