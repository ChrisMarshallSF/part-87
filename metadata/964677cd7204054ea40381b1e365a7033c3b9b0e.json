How all the things end in a happy note is the rest of the film.\n\nAbout the film:\nThe film has nothing new to tell. It goes in a predictable routine way. Only plus points of the film are the songs. iMtElE nirupEdala bratukulu , eMta sogasugaa unnaavu ilaa, pedavulapaina saMgeetaM , manasu paaDiMdi sannaayi paaTa are all time great hits.\nThe lead pair N.T.R and Krishnakumari has only one song and two hit songs are on Shoban and two other hit songs are on Harinath and Jyothy laxmi. \n\nI think because Nirdhoshi flopped NTR gave dates to this film (by the same director).\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: Xvid ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1886 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 64kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Telugu\nRunTime: 2:08:40\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 2:05:40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:964677cd7204054ea40381b1e365a7033c3b9b0e","amp;dn":"Punyavathi+%281967%29+Telugu+Xvid+2cd+-+No+Subs+-+NTR%2C+Bhanumathi+%5BD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"964677cd7204054ea40381b1e365a7033c3b9b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,70,119,205,114,4,5,78,164,3,129,177,227,101,167,3,60,59,155,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
