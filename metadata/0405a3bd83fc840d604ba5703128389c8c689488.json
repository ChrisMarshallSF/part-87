Many false prophets have been exposed over time and many more have yet to surface.  So many Christians today jump at various prophetic interpretations merely because they sound nice but fail to investigate the scriptures, themsleves, for proper understanding of interpretations.  As a result, many are being deceived simply because they do not verify these prophetic interpretations with the scriptures that identify them.\n\nIt has not been long ago that communism would give us Antichrist. Then it was the European Union. Now it is Islam! It appears that what or whoever is the evil champ of the day is the candidate for the job. How long will you allow yourself to be influenced by foolishness? Learn to think for yourself.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Events In Prophecy:\nThis video outlines some current events and various headlines within and out the church that boldly declare we need to get serious about preparing for our Lord's soon return.  I pray you are blessed by what is shared here.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEaster or Passover - The Pagan Passover or God's Passover:\nEaster, or Easter Sunday, is a beloved tradition to many people when the resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. The origins of Easter, however, prove that it is a pagan substitute for the Biblical Passover. Early Christians observed Passover for hundreds of years until paganism corrupted the once-pure faith with the worshiping of the queen of heaven and all of the pagan traditions. All who wish to commemorate the Saviour's sacrifice will do so on the memorial of His death: Passover, not Easter. Easter is Pagan fraud designed to replace Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits, the TRUE feasts that represent the death, burial, and Resurrection of Yahushua!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPastor Levy's Prophetic Warning that America is the modern biblical Egypt:\nA very interesting interview that expresses a prophetic warning that links the United States with ancient Egypt and America's upcoming similar judgement as identified in scripture.  This eery warning helps us realize how close we mirror ancient biblical times, illustrating the old adage of &quot;history repeats&quot;.  Something we should all think about as we progress in our Christian journey.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Has Happened to America?\nThe American economy is stretched thin with the smallest percentage of Americans ever in the workforce. Dissatisfaction with government has never been this high, but demands from government have also never been as high as they are now. What gives? Americans hate big government, but they want more out of their government! Charlie Daniels asked &quot;What has happened to America?&quot; The Generations team attempts an answer to this question.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 57:\nA folder compiled of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today to help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
