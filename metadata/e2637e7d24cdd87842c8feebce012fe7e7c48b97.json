There is also an update about the Ebola patient in the US, he goes through Twitter hashtags, ISIS and/or ISIL, and we watch a clip of Bill Maher and Ben Affleck debating Muslims. Michael Skolnik then joins the show via phone for an intense debate about race, equality, and the culture of our nation. Ant takes some glorious calls, shows us a video of a menacing man trying to cheat the system, and goes through MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mail. After a few more callers, we see how advertisements have changed over the years and end the show viewing a few clips from a straight up crazy bitch.\n\t\n**long days no sleep..So I screwed up again and tagged the mp3 as MP4..my bad\nThis is the video version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2637e7d24cdd87842c8feebce012fe7e7c48b97","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-06+%28MP4%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2637e7d24cdd87842c8feebce012fe7e7c48b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,99,126,125,36,205,216,120,66,200,254,235,206,1,47,231,231,196,139,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
