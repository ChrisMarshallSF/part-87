The level of the book has deliberately been maintained at the introductory level to avoid confusion of the student by inclusion of more advanced material, and is unique in that its text is limited to the amount suitable for a one term course for students in materials science, ceramics or inorganic chemistry. The contents cover the fundamental topics of importance in glass science and technology, including glass formation, crystallization, phase separation and structure of glasses. Additional chapters discuss the most important properties of glasses, including discussion of physical, optical, electrical, chemical and mechanical properties","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb423ab1a01921aba5dfa63c9f95c774a4ce11da","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Glass+Science+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb423ab1a01921aba5dfa63c9f95c774a4ce11da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,66,58,177,160,25,33,171,165,223,166,60,159,149,199,116,164,206,17,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
