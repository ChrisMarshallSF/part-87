Two guitars, drums, and lots of yelling. They were comprised of the dueling vocals and guitars of Mitch Dubey and Chris Z (The Flaming Tsunamis), with drummer Morgan Norris and original bassist Kyle Connecticut, who left the band after their demo tape. After a brief slumber and booking a return show with Spraynard and Glocca Morra, tragedy struck when Mitch Dubey was murdered in his New Haven home on the night of March 24th, 2011 during a home invasion robbery gone wrong. Swear JarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings will remain as a reminder of MitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent and his ever-positive outlook on life. \n\nDemo Tape\n1- You Bet It Does\n2- Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Time Travel\n3- Freezer Plate\n4- Charles Bronson (The Man, Not The Band)\n5- Synapes Fire\n\nSpring 2010 Tour Sampler\n1- ...and Peanut Butter\n2- The Matches That Light The Fire To This Small Town Pt. 1\n3- You Bet It Does\n\nSwear Jar\n1- The Matches That Light The Fire To This Small Town Pt. 1\n2- Synapses Fire\n3- Freezer Plate\n4- Viper Shark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12b218185deb923b3904190ea8de795bbf746da","amp;dn":"Swear+Jar+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12b218185deb923b3904190ea8de795bbf746da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,43,33,129,133,222,185,35,179,144,65,144,234,141,231,149,187,247,70,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
