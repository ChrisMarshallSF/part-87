This is truly worldwide music, by the 'new king of Klezmer clarinet' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ noblesse oblige.\n\nYOM and the Wonder Rabbis\nWith Love (2011)\nPsychedelic post-klezmer trip rock\nYom returns Ã¢â‚¬ËœWith LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and explores Balkan trip hop, Turksisch post rock and Romanian electronics. This explosive cocktail may disturb purists, but draws on the background of klezmer: acknowledging the power of a simple gesture to help a neighbor or stranger. And so Yom leads us into a universe of comics where he aims to distribute love with his clarinet to our mad world. \nHis sidekicks Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Wonder RabbisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ add more jazz, funk and psychedelic rock than ever before, making Yom a cartoon character to be taken seriously!\n\nThe Empire of Love (2013)\nAn inveterate thrillseeker, with his latest album The Empire of Love, the innovative klezmer clarinetist Yom launches himself into a new space-time continuum where French house, cyber-klezmer, and\nsci-fi jazz convergeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦  Surging forwards with supercharged rhythms, threaded with shimmering strings and futuristic vocals, captivating melodies erupt from the acoustic purity of the clarinet to create music that is indefinable.  Balkan Turbo Folk?  Middle Eastern Dance Music?  New wave Lyrical Electro?  All that and more no doubt, contribute to an avant-garde musical manifesto that is held together by an impressively rich soundscape, a sublime hymn to love as much as a fantastical psychedelic trip; we stand on the cusp of a brave new world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e4880a4760aee953c3c1a002a21c8436ff0151c","amp;dn":"Yom+-+3+LP+2009-2011++%5BJazz+Klezmer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e4880a4760aee953c3c1a002a21c8436ff0151c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,72,128,164,118,10,238,149,60,60,26,0,42,33,200,67,111,240,21,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
