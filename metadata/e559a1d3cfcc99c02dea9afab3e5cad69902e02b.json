It proceeds from the world of knots to their complementary spaces, what's not a knot. Profound theorems of mathematics show that most known complements carry the structure of hyperbolic geometry, a geometry in which the sum of three angles of a triangle always is less than 180 degrees.\n\nThe video shows the geometry of the knot complement, the space around the knot, changing into hyperbolic space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e559a1d3cfcc99c02dea9afab3e5cad69902e02b","amp;dn":"Knot+Not%2C+topology+knot+theory+mathematics+video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e559a1d3cfcc99c02dea9afab3e5cad69902e02b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,89,161,211,207,204,153,192,45,234,154,250,179,229,202,214,153,2,224,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
