The following 4 rips are included:. See for yourself which you prefer.\n\n* SPARKS 1080p 8.74GB, audio DTS 6ch 1509 kbps\n* Anoxmous 1080p 2.35GB, audio AAC, both 6ch 384 kbps and 2ch 124 kbps\n* YIFY 1080p 1.85GB, audio 2ch AAC 92 kbps\n* YIFY 720p 870MB, audio 2ch AAC 92 kbps\n\nPersonally I think that this movie deserves a 1080p rip if you have at least a 40&quot; screen, but that there's no need to choose anything bigger than Anoxmous or YIFY 1080p since they have almost indistinguishable video quality compared to the 8.74GB rip. And if you have surround sound to choose Anoxmous - it has 6ch audio, and most people won't have any use for better audio than the 384k 6ch AAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4343597c285dcf04e4e65c9f50b7272ea49ed48","amp;dn":"Screenshots+Guardians+of+the+Galaxy+YIFY%2C+SPARKS%2C+Anoxmous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4343597c285dcf04e4e65c9f50b7272ea49ed48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,52,53,151,194,133,220,240,78,78,101,201,245,11,114,114,234,73,237,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
