When brother and sister Jim and Anita opened Vietnamese restaurant Pho Barclay there were lines out the door. One year later the business has slowed and the food has become boring and predictable. Ching is shocked to discover that Anita is bank rolling the struggling business as well as financing her brother's hobby as an amateur inventor. Jim and Anita need to focus their resources on the restaurant and reinvent their food and decor if it's to survive. They tell Ching they're up for change...but are they really up for the challenge?\n\nthanks to capper and poster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b6887ba4158638911368538e7ec498aad16d5b","amp;dn":"Restaurant+Redemption+S02E02+Pho+Barclay+WS+DSR+x264-%5BNY2%5D+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b6887ba4158638911368538e7ec498aad16d5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,182,136,123,164,21,134,56,145,19,104,83,142,126,196,152,170,209,109,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
