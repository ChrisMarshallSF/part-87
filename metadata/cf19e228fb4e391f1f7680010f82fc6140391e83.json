Stefan Molyneux breaks down the basics of the genetic warfare which is the foundation of all living creatures. Different reproduction strategies have emerged over time and this is explained through r/K Selection Theory. When you look at humanity through the lens of reproduction strategies - it's something you can never, and will never, be able to unsee!\n\nEpisode II\n\nAn examination of the biological and genetic basis for political ideologies: Do genetics determine if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a liberal or conservative? What role does r/K selection theory play in the world where we live? How big is your amygdala - and what does that mean about your possible political perspective? Includes a look at the Prefrontal Cortex, Anterior Cingulate Cortex and the impact of dopamine in the realm of political biology. \n\nEpisode III\n\nFor many decades, two main reproductive strategies have been recognized by biologists - this is referred to as r/K Selection Theory. When you look at humanity through the lens of reproduction strategies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ things quickly begin snapping into place and a battle for genetic survival is revealed. \n\nIn the area of public discourse, these two survival strategies battle for ultimate supremacy. In the latest installment of the controversial Gene Wars series, Stefan Molyneux analyses various political positions and attitudes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including how they are shaped and explained through r/K Selection Theory.\n\n\n\nDescription:\n\nOver 100 million downloads!
