The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the &quot;Gothenburg metal&quot; scene.\n\n\nArtist: Dark Tranquillity\nYear: 1993-2013\nGenre: Melodic Death Metal/GÃƒÂ¶teborg Metal\nCountry: Sweden\nFormat / Codec: FLAC\n\n\nDiscography, including the &quot;Construct&quot; album\n\n1993 - Skydancer - Of Chaos And Eternal Night [Reissue 1996]\n1995 - The Gallery [2005 Deluxe Edition]\n1996 - Enter Suicidal Angels [EP]\n1997 - The Mind's I [2005 Deluxe Edition]\n1999 - Projector [2009 Anniversary Edition]\n2000 - Haven [2009 Anniversary Edition]\n2002 - Damage Done [2009 Anniversary Edition]\n2004 - Exposures - In Retrospect And Denial 2CD\n2004 - Lost To Apathy EP\n2005 - Character\n2007 - Fiction - Expanded Edition\n2009 - Yesterworlds\n2009 - Where Death Is Most Alive 2CD\n2010 - We Are The Void \n2013 - Construct\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce0f7ca452118f10813a96d81da7005f7b5cbcb9","amp;dn":"Dark+Tranquillity+-+Discography+%281993+-+2015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce0f7ca452118f10813a96d81da7005f7b5cbcb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,15,124,164,82,17,143,16,129,58,150,216,29,167,0,95,123,92,188,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
