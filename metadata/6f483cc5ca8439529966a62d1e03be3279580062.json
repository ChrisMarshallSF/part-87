After his debut album 'MY SON' was released in 2013 to much critical acclaim CHAMPA has travelled globally with his fullon and uplifting psychedelic sounds. He has collaborated with such artists as Ital, Krunch, Mechanimal and Lisa Lashes as well as charting regularly on Beatport with his solo tracks and EP's on globally renowned labels. 'TIGER' represents a far more mature production approach and takes the listener on a journey through progressive beats to fully charged acid lines layered with trademark vocal samples and unrelenting bass lines. It also introduces the audience to a host of new production talent and collaborative efforts.\n\nSupport the artists you like by buying their music! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.champalive.com/tiger.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.champalive.com/tiger.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/release/tiger/1399028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/release/tiger/1399028&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f483cc5ca8439529966a62d1e03be3279580062","amp;dn":"Champa+-+Tiger+%282014%29+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f483cc5ca8439529966a62d1e03be3279580062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,72,60,197,202,132,57,82,153,102,166,45,30,3,190,50,121,88,0,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
