Young never enjoyed any commercial success himself, but this shows why he was considered with such high regard among his peers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0205c97bddcb94216f84ce63105f45dd5f04563b","amp;dn":"Steve+Young+-+Lonesome%2C+On%27ry+%26amp%3B+Mean+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0205c97bddcb94216f84ce63105f45dd5f04563b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,5,201,123,221,203,148,33,111,132,206,99,16,95,69,221,95,4,86,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
