Narrated by Lindsay McDougall (The Doctor from Triple J), the film contains footage from over 50 farms and slaughterhouses across Australia - much of this footage has never been seen before.\n\nRated MA15+.\n\nMore information at aussiepigs.com/lucent or on our Facebook page,\n\nThis is the Original .MP4 file (1920x1080 / 3GB) file available for free download from the movie's official Vimeo watch page:\n\nSetup as a torrent for faster downloading thanks to peer-to-peer dynamics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c4d4866fd2745e7bec27f34ad77d25f2df1e92","amp;dn":"Lucent+%5B2014%5D+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c4d4866fd2745e7bec27f34ad77d25f2df1e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,196,212,134,111,210,116,94,123,236,39,243,74,215,125,37,242,223,30,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
