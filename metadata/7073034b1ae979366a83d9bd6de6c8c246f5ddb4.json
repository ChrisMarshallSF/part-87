It is the sixth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, a spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, though no direct story connection exists to previous entries. It was released in May and July 2013 for Japan and North America respectively. It was released digitally in Europe in October 2014. The gameplay is reminiscent of previous Shin Megami Tensei games, carrying over the turn-based Press Turn battle system, where players and enemies fight and exploit weaknesses, gaining or losing turns depending on whether or not they strike weaknesses.\n\nThe story focuses on Flynn, a Samurai who protects the medieval Kingdom of Mikado from attacks by hostile demons. When a mysterious Black Samurai begins transforming the population into devils, Flynn and three companions are sent to capture her. The pursuit of the Black Samurai drags Flynn and his comrades into a startling revelation and a power struggle between angelic and demonic forces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7073034b1ae979366a83d9bd6de6c8c246f5ddb4","amp;dn":"%283DS%29+AMXE+-+Shin+Megami+Tensei+IV+%28US%29+GW+2.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7073034b1ae979366a83d9bd6de6c8c246f5ddb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,115,3,75,26,233,121,54,106,131,217,189,109,230,200,194,70,245,221,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
