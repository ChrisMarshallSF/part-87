They also issued an annual (what other kind is there?) calendar from (at least) the years 1972 through 1979 (as far as I can tell).  I remember my brother having one of these calendars when I was about 10 years old and thought it was the most hilarious thing ever.  I am still looking for a copy of the one that he used to have, I think it was 1975. Anyway, for those interested in a look back at the 70s (and who isn't), here is a tiny glimpse of what was going on.  At least in Montana.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed1a965f8e3c49608ffdaedd7fc692afdfdd7080","amp;dn":"Wretched+Mess+Calendar+1972.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed1a965f8e3c49608ffdaedd7fc692afdfdd7080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,26,150,95,142,60,73,96,143,253,174,221,127,198,146,175,223,221,112,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
