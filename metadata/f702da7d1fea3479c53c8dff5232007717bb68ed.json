Ford had originally assembled this lineup to record his 1979 solo album The Inside Story which was released under the name of Robben Ford. During this initial period the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound combined elements of blues, jazz fusion, and progressive rock with Ford contributing vocals. Over the next year the group began moving in a more democratic direction, eliminating FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and embracing a more commercially oriented jazz-funk approach overall and the band signed with Warner Bros. as Yellowjackets.\n\nThis is one of The Yellowjackets' most jazz-oriented sets. Roughly half of the music uses funky rhtyhms while the remainder is straightahead. &quot;Jacket Town&quot; sounds like it could have come from a good Eddie Harris record, Bob Mintzer's tenor is heard on a rapid run-through of rhythm changes on &quot;Runferyerlife,&quot; keyboardist Russell Ferrante hints strongly at Chick Corea's acoustic playing on &quot;Muhammed&quot; and Mintzer's ballad &quot;Sage&quot; is memorable. This fine release is recommended both to The Yellowjackets' longtime fans and those listeners who mistakenly think that this popular group is a mundane fusion band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f702da7d1fea3479c53c8dff5232007717bb68ed","amp;dn":"Yellowjackets+-+Run+For+Your+Life+%281994%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f702da7d1fea3479c53c8dff5232007717bb68ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,2,218,125,31,234,52,121,197,60,141,255,82,50,0,119,23,187,104,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
