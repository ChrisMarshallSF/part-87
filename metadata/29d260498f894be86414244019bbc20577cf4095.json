After the advent of sound, only a comparatively small number of mythological filmsÃ¢â‚¬â€which a Bombay director once aptly described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“stunt films that happen to be about godsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€ continued to be made, generally with low budgets and catering to a niche market of pious grandmothers and rustics (e.g., JAI SANTOSHI MAA, 1975, which, however, became an unexpected hit). Occasionally, though, a major director or studio would undertake a big-budget spectacle based on the great pan-Indian epics; thus special-effects pioneer Babubhai Mistry directed SAMPOORNA RAMAYAN (Ã¢â‚¬Å“complete RamayanaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) in 1961Ã¢â‚¬â€remaking the 1936 Telugu opus that was allegedly the only film that the prudish (but Rama-loving) Mahatma Gandhi would ever consent to watchÃ¢â‚¬â€and four years later he took on the other and darker Sanskrit epic, the fratricidal and ominous Mahabharata.\n\nGiven the infamous length and complexity of this textÃ¢â‚¬â€100,000 couplets comprising a veritable encyclopedia of classical didactic and narrative literatureÃ¢â‚¬â€any cinematic adaptation is inevitably going to be partial and significantly condensed. In look and spirit, MistryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production most closely resembles a popular Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amar Chitra KathaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comic book come to life, presenting a synopsis of the epicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core story of warring clans of cousins as a series of brief episodes, most of which are centered around tableaux that closely adhere to the conventions long established by popular visual artistsÃ¢â‚¬â€the creators of the ubiquitous and brightly-colored Ã¢â‚¬Å“god postersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the Indian bazaar. The director assumes that his audience is already familiar with these episodes, allowing for even greater condensation; some key narrative events, indeed, are merely alluded to in passing. Sometimes badly-garbled subtitles add to the challenge that this film poses to uninitiated Anglophone viewers (see additional comments on this problem below, in the final section concerning the DVD), but those who have already been introduced to the Mahabharata story should generally be able to follow whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on. Though there is little in the way of original interpretation here, this brightly-tinted spectacle appears to have helped cement some of the visual and character conventions that, decades later, would be echoed B. R. ChopraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hugely-popular (and hugely huge) 94-episode television serialization.\n\nThe film entirely skips the complex origins of the disputed succession to the throne of Hastinapura (Ã¢â‚¬Å“city of the elephantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), contested by the descendants of the half-brothers Pandu and DhritarashtraÃ¢â‚¬â€the Pandavas and KauravasÃ¢â‚¬â€and opens with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“graduationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tournament in which all these princes, schooled in weaponry by the brahman preceptor Drona, show off their skills. We see the mace-fight between the second Pandava brother Bhima (played by champion wrestler and stunt-film star Dara Singh) and his arch-enemy Duryodhana, which is ultimately interrupted by the elders when it threatens to become too violent. This is followed by the surprise challenge to the supreme archer Arjuna (Pradeep Kumar), by his near-double KarnaÃ¢â‚¬â€ostensibly a lowly charioteerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, though in fact the illegitimate first son of ArjunaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mother, Kunti, begotten by the sun god himself. After being ridiculed in the arena as a non-kshatriya (non-aristocrat and warrior, and hence an unsuitable sparring-partner for Arjuna), Karna is befriended and given a nominal kingdom by the senior Kaurava prince Duryodhana, resulting in his fateful oath of lifelong loyalty to his benefactor.\n\nIn keeping with some folk interpretations of the Mahabharata, Duryodhana is portrayed as an oafish puppet whose strings are pulled by his mama or maternal uncle, the sinister dice-master Shakuni. The latter is invariably accompanied by his son Uluk (Ã¢â‚¬Å“owl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a bird regarded as both impure and stupid in Indian animal lore), who serves as a buffoon. Shakuni and his disciples plot the ruin of the five Pandava brothersÃ¢â‚¬â€the rightful heirs to the Hastinapura throneÃ¢â‚¬â€by first trying to burn them alive in a highly-combustible Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shellac PalaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€a famous episode that is here greatly compressed (the fire, set by the builder Purochana himself, occurs on the princesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first night in Varanavata, and the tunnel through which they escape has been built without their knowledge at the command of their uncle Vidura; a wordless and momentary vignette of a peasant woman and her five sons running into the palace as a storm approaches alludes to the tribal Nishada family that is burned to death in the PandavasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ place, confirming the false report that they have died). This quickly leads to BhimaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encounter in the forest with a brother-sister pair of rakshasas (monstrous but magical supernaturals who guard wild places and often devour human beings), Hidimba and Hidimbaa. The latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love for him occasions the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first song and dance sequence (Champakali chhup chhup jaye re, Ã¢â‚¬Å“flower buds are bashfully hidingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and after Bhima dispatches HidimbaaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother, mother Kunti blesses their odd union (a telling contrast to the treatment of the rakshasi Shurpanakha in the Ramayana!), which produces the giant Pandava-ally Ghatotkacha (Ã¢â‚¬Å“pot-headÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€of the vessel variety). When KrishnaÃ¢â‚¬â€the PandavasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ doting cousin and also the avatar or incarnation of god VishnuÃ¢â‚¬â€encounters the latter in the forest, he thus learns that his favorite cousins have survived the Varanavata inferno.\n\nThis leads to his recognition of them when, disguised as brahmans, they attend the swayamvara or marriage tournament of princess Draupadi of Panchala (Padmini), a willful and sharp-tongued lass. Following the failure of Duryodhana and other princes to hit a cleverly-contrived target with an arrow, Arjuna succeeds and wins the brideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage garland. But when he brings Draupadi to his mother, the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accidental remark that he and his brothers must share the Ã¢â‚¬Å“almsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ they have received that day leads to the storyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous and unorthodox polyandrous marriage. Now wed to the daughter of a powerful ally, the Pandavas return to Hastinapura to demand their share of the kingdom, and the timid Dhritarashtra consents to give them the uninhabited forest tract of Khandavaprastha, which (with KrishnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help) the divine architect Vishvakarma (not, as in the Sanskrit text, the asuric builder Maya) soon transforms for them into a glittering new capital, Indraprastha. Here the Pandavas conduct an imperial Rajasuya sacrifice in the course of which their guest-of-honor, Krishna, decapitates King Shishupala of Cedi, after the latter repeatedly insults him. The film adds a common folk expansion on this episode: Krishna nicks his finger on the buzz-saw-like discus used to accomplish the slaying, and Draupadi hastens to tear off a strip of her sari to bandage itÃ¢â‚¬â€an act of devoted service that (viewers know) Krishna will quickly and abundantly repay. There follows the comical episode of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maya MahalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“palace of illusionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), a sort of fun-house that Vishvakarma has thrown into the Indraprastha master-plan. When Arjuna offers his rival cousins a tour, Duryodhana is dazzled by its wonders and repeatedly embarrassed by its trompe lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oeil tricks, culminating in DraupadiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cruel mockery of him (when he falls into a concealed pond) as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the blind son of a blind father!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Returning to Hastinapura, he vows to take revenge.\n\nThis happens during the fateful dicing match, when dharma-king Yudhishthira, unaccountably possessed by gambling fever, wagers the brothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wife as his final stake, and loses. The epicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two matches are here condensed into a single game of a mere three wagers, and its shocking insults and horrific vows are somewhat sanitized (we are not told that Draupadi is menstruating, Duryodhana slaps but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bare his left thigh, and Bhima vows to rip off DuhshasanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arm rather than to tear open his chest and drink his heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood), but the film endorses the popular tradition of Draupadi vowing never to bind her hair until she can oil it with DuhshasanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood. Much of the scene, expectedly, is devoted to DuhshasanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempted disrobing of the PandavasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ queen, and to the miracle of the endless sari, invisibly renewed from KrishnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own hand, that protects her modesty.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 2230 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 64kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:42:48\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 163 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d260498f894be86414244019bbc20577cf4095","amp;dn":"Mahabharat+%281965%29+MHCe+DVD5+-+Eng+Subs+-+Pradeep+Kumar.%2C+Padmini","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d260498f894be86414244019bbc20577cf4095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,210,96,73,143,137,75,232,100,20,36,64,25,187,194,5,119,207,64,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
