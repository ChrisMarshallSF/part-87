Dust and Disquiet\n\nCaspian present Dust &amp; Disquiet, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first full length since 2012. The band returned to Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts again with producer Matt Bayless (Mastodon, Minus The Bear, Isis) where they recorded the highly acclaimed Waking Season (Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Best Post-Rock Album of Year,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said SPIN Magazine in 2012). The result showcases a maturation of the quiet/loud dynamic that Caspian has been exploring since their debut EP, You Are the Conductor. The new album reflects the many moods of post-rock from the album opener with horns and a string quartet (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Separation No. 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), riffs on the wilder, steel-eyed side of country (Ã¢â‚¬Å“RiosecoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), all the while staying true to its epic brand of build-and-release rock (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arcs of Command,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dust &amp; DisquietÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Look for Caspian to headline across the US through the Fall of 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:964166485b3bf8b8ed6cd168d3d8e11acbdc37bc","amp;dn":"Caspian+-+Dust+and+Disquiet+%282015%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"964166485b3bf8b8ed6cd168d3d8e11acbdc37bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,65,102,72,91,59,248,184,237,108,209,104,211,216,225,26,203,220,55,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
