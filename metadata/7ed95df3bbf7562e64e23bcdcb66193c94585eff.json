The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins' backing group The Hawks one by one between 1958 and 1963.\n\nCahoots is the fourth studio album by Canadian/American rock group the Band released in 1971 and was their last all-original studio album for four years. It received only mixed reviews when it first appeared. Robbie Robertson wrote or co-wrote all but one of the album tracks, Bob Dylan's &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;. Robertson's occasional co-writers include Danko and Helm on &quot;Life is a Carnival&quot;, and Van Morrison on &quot;4% Pantomime&quot;.\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;Life Is a Carnival&quot;  \t        3:55\n2. &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;  \t4:21\n3. &quot;Last of the Blacksmiths&quot;   \t        3:41\n4. &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot;   \t3:47\n5. &quot;4% Pantomime&quot;  \t                4:32\n6. &quot;Shoot Out in Chinatown&quot;   \t        2:51\n7. &quot;The Moon Struck One&quot;   \t        4:09\n8. &quot;Thinkin' Out Loud&quot;   \t        3:19\n9. &quot;Smoke Signal&quot;   \t                5:11\n10. &quot;Volcano&quot;   \t                3:05\n11. &quot;The River Hymn&quot;   \t                4:40\n\nDFF files extracted with Scarletbook\nfrom the 2009 Hybrid Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab SACD \n\nMFSL-SACD-ISO-DFF-1Bit-2.8Mhz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed95df3bbf7562e64e23bcdcb66193c94585eff","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+Cahoots+%281971%29+2009+MFSL-SACD-DFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed95df3bbf7562e64e23bcdcb66193c94585eff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,217,93,243,187,247,86,46,100,226,59,205,203,102,25,60,148,88,94,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
