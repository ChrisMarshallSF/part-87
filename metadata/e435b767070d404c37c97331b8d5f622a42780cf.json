They wanted to prove it was a neural net, so they picked Backgammon as a proof. \n This is the installer for jellyfish lite, which is FREE! You can find out more at jelly.effect.no, or some other site in Norway! \nEnjoy. \nAnd don't let me catch you at the first internet backgammon site, fibs.com! \nIt's for those of us who are from very good to terrible! and there are many robots, like blunderbot 1,2,3,etc and gammonbot 1,2,3,etc. Don't even play the gammonbots, or your score will go down as you LOSE!
