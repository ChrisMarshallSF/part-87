The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises.              \n\nACTORS: \nWarwick Davis, Charlie Heath, Shevonne Durkin, Sandy Baron, Adam Biesk, James Lancaster, \n\nRELEASED: \n 8 April 1994 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110329/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 8214358133 bytes (7.65 GiB), duration: 01:25:23, avg.bitrate: 12827 kb/s\nAudio: dts, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 1920x1080, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=10822587126724402721.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=10822587126724402721.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : PHOBOS\n Movie Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c1e4b6b6c722d4cfaf9e2fdc2c0b78bbf4b013","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+2+1994+1080p+BluRay+x264-PHOBOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c1e4b6b6c722d4cfaf9e2fdc2c0b78bbf4b013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,193,228,182,182,199,34,212,207,175,158,47,220,44,11,120,187,244,176,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
