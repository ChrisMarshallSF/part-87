A founding member of the acclaimed band Squeeze, he went on to play with many other groups, and pursued a solo career, in addition to his stints as a TV presenter ,and dabblings in architecture of eccentric leanings. His show LATER...WITH JOOLS HOLLAND marked a resurrection of quality British music programming, and has become known for the consistently excellent talent it features. The series is also set apart by the jam session of all the artists featured on each episode, often accompanied by Jools himself on the piano. This collection includes the best in contemporary hip hop, with over 30 performances from popular artists. \n\n\n1.Family Affair Mary J.
