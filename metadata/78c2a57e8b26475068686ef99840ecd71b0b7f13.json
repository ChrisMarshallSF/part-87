Clutching\n                at straws, Zak sets off with Belle to buy a Eurobillions rollover\n                week ticket. As Zak and Belle make their way to purchase the\n                ticket, we enter two parallel universes and the fun enfolds as\n                fate serves up very different futures with their lucky numbers\n                and potential winning ticket. We then seamlessly experience the\n                two ever shifting worlds as the most turn of events leads the\n                extended Dingle family into two parallel but polar opposite futures.\n\n                Will it be the reality of winning the lottery that brings delight,\n                or will the harsher reality of lies and bogus tickets leave the clan\n                counting the cost of nearly winning a fortune? The havoc unfolds with\n                hilarious results as the film asks the question How much would\n                winning the lottery change you?\n\n   _________________________________________________________________________\n   _________________________________________________________________________\n    \n                        ...WE NEED HELP WiTH ANY OF...\n\n   Secure EUR/USA/ASiAN affil site.\n   Suppliers of all ENGLISH/ITALIAN/FRENCH/FOREiGN Movies/Games/Music/XXX etc.\n   Suppliers of Old or New DVDs or BluRays.
