Glorified by Calderon, Voltaire, and Goethe, she is yet familiar to the man in the street, and &quot;Pandora's box&quot; is a byword. She has been amply discussed by historians of Greek religion and literature, but little attention has been paid to her history in the postclassical era. Pandora is practically absent\nfrom major Latin literature, she was nearly forgotten during the Middle Ages, and her revival in the Renaissance took place under abnormal conditions: she came to life in France rather than Italy, and she achieved popularity as a literary rather than an artistic figure. The very attribute that made her famous was originally neither a box nor, properly, hers.\n\nThe present study, containing some 60 halftone illustrations, traces the history of Pandora and of &quot;Pandora's box&quot; in European literature and art from Roman times to the present","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3ca76140333aa54a925c6fb2512adf857b10a4","amp;dn":"Pandoras+box+-+the+changing+aspects+of+a+mythical+symbol+by+Dora","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3ca76140333aa54a925c6fb2512adf857b10a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,60,167,97,64,51,58,165,74,146,92,111,178,81,42,223,133,123,16,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
