Mankind enters a new age of seemingly endless peace and prosperity called the Regild Century. The year is R.C. 1014. The Capital Tower, an orbital elevator, connects earth and space. Due to its role in supplying Earth`s power by transferring Photon Batteries from space, it is worshiped with a religious fervor. [Bellri Zenam], a cadet in the Capital Guard formed to protect Capital Tower, is participating in his first non-simulated exercise when he is attacked by the powerful but unaffiliated [G-Self] mobile suit. He manages to capture the G-Self while piloting a [Recten] maintenance mobile suit. However, seeing the G-Self`s pilot, a young space pirate named [Aida Rayhunton], stirs something within him, as does the G-Self which he was sure he`d never seen before. Aida`s mission to attack Capital Tower. Bellri`s destiny as a chosen pilot of the G-Self. The truth which will shake the Regild Century. It was all the beginning of the Reconguista.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage:\n\nAudio:\t\t\t\t\t : JAP\nText/Subs:\t\t\t\t : ENG[hardcoded]\n\nVideo:\n\nDuration                                 : 24mn 30s\nBit rate                                 : 1 667 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 24mn 30s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 281 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\nVideo Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\nSubtitle Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\n\nThanks in advance to all people who will seed the torrent for as long as they can. ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b2d92b3385d48d94c089e0bc917c044d705d6d","amp;dn":"%5Bthund3r3mp3ror%5D+Gundam+Reconguista+In+G+-+07+%5B720p%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b2d92b3385d48d94c089e0bc917c044d705d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,178,217,43,51,133,212,141,148,192,137,224,188,145,124,4,77,112,93,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
