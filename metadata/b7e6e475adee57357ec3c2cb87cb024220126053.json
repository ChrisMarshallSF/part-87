With a fleet that had dominated this theater since the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese anticipated certain victory against the US forces. Outgunned and under strength, the US Navy nevertheless had superior intelligence that cracked the code well before the battle's onset: the Japanese ambush did not come as a surprise. From July 4-7, 1942, the US dealt a devastating blow to the Imperial Japanese Fleet, sinking four irreplaceable aircraft carriers, and clearing the way for the island-hopping US counterattack. Characterized by espionage, daring, luck, and extreme heroism on both sides, the story of Midway is vividly retold in compelling graphic novel format. This book also includes eight pages of authoritative information, placing the battle in its historical context, describing the key players, and its build-up and aftermath","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e6e475adee57357ec3c2cb87cb024220126053","amp;dn":"The+Empire+Falls%3A+Battle+of+Midway+%28Graphic+History%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e6e475adee57357ec3c2cb87cb024220126053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,230,228,117,173,238,87,53,126,195,194,203,135,203,2,66,32,18,96,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
