FelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movie is based on PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Bet the Devil Your Head.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Poe was sick of the literary establishment railing against his work for not having a moral for the audience, so he wrote a tongue-in-cheek tale that had a thuddingly obvious one. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the title. In the story, Toby Dammit is a foolish lad who, in spite of having no money, would bet on anything, using his head as collateral. Eventually, the devil takes him up on the offer and, not surprisingly, Dammit loses his head. Literally.\n\nThe movie has little of the satirical edge of PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, but FelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flashy decadence meshes surprisingly well with PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brooding morbidity. Terence Stamp plays Dammit, a washed up, alcoholic Shakespearean actor who looks a bit like a bleached out version of Poe himself. Lured by promises of a Ferrari, he goes to Rome to appear in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first Catholic Western. Dammit soon finds himself haunted by visions of the devil. No red horns here. This Satan comes in the form of a creepy blonde girl who looks like she was pulled straight out of a Japanese horror movie. The second half of the movie is a phantasmagoric joy ride as a crazed Dammit blasts through the streets of Rome in his new car.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a drive straight to a very Felliniesque hell.\n\nAll of FelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark stylistic traits are there on the screen. Gorgeous, if vapid women, in elaborate hairstyles? Check. Bizarre Catholic imagery? Check. Paparazzi asking improbably philosophical questions? Yup. Fellini turns PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tortured gloom into the sort of spiraling existential malaise that he perfected in La Dolce Vita and 8 Ã‚Â½. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Fellini fan, this film really is a joy to watch.\n\nThough FelliniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s segment was the clear stand out of the three shorts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New York Times critic Vincent Canby declared Toby Dammit to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“short movie but a major oneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the other two movies werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as well received and Spirits of the Dead was soon forgotten. Then renowned cinematographer and Fellini collaborator Giuseppe Rotunno had Toby Dammit restored. When it screened at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, it was hailed as a lost Fellini masterpiece","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd2c7eabc18ed4115c4734e57b56852a8082583","amp;dn":"Federico+Fellini+-+Toby+Dammit+%281968%29+Edgar+Allan+Poe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd2c7eabc18ed4115c4734e57b56852a8082583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,210,199,234,188,24,237,65,21,196,115,78,87,181,104,82,168,8,37,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
