Black Night\n\nArthur Alexander may have been overshadowed by the performers who covered his songs (the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bee Gees, etc), but he was never out-performed by his peers.\nLike most baby boomers, I first became aware of Alexander when the Beatles covered &quot;Anna&quot; on The Early Beatles. Then about ten years ago I picked up a used copy of a mid-Eighties Rhino release called Beatle Originals. It featured thirteen original versions of songs that the Beatles covered on their early albums. Among the tracks was Alexander's touching version of &quot;Anna.&quot; Lennon did a nice job of copying Alexander's vocal style and it would show up again on songs like &quot;In My Life.&quot; [Lennon would also provide the lead vocal on another of Alexander's songs, &quot;Soldier of Love,&quot; which can be heard on Live At The BBC.]\nAlexander shared something else in common with Lennon besides great taste in song selection. They were both born in 1940. Why Alexander's Beatles connection never resulted in a major career boost is puzzling. His only Top 40 hit was the tender &quot;You Better Move On&quot; in 1962.\nThis is terrific country-soul from one of the music world's best but mostly forgotten talents. In Dave Marsh's book The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made, he included both &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Soldier of Love.&quot; This is a fitting tribute to an amazing singer. Alexander died of a heart attack in 1993. This Ace collection covers all the highlights from his tenure atand belongs in in any serious collector's music library.
