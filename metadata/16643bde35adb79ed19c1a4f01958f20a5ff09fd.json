Funk is actually a P-Funk project through and through. Some of P-Funk's most legendary graduates -- Bernie Worrell, Billy &quot;Bass&quot; Nelson, Jerome &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Brailey, and Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper, along with such collaborators as Grandmaster Melle Mel and Bill Laswell -- construct a sound that's very close to mid-period Funkadelic records such as Let's Take It to the Stage and Cosmic Slop. The music ranges from the &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;-like epic &quot;Music for My Brother,&quot; an instrumental tribute to Eddie Hazel, to the thundering funk-rock of &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; (which recasts the intro to Funkadelic's &quot;Music for My Mother&quot;) to &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; (a reworking of &quot;I Wanna Know If It's Good to You&quot;). \n\n\n    &quot;Yeah, Yeah, Yeah&quot; (James Whipper, Melvin Glover, William Nelson)\n    &quot;Funk is in the House&quot; (James Whipper, William Nelson)\n    &quot;Funkadelic Groupie&quot; (Bronx Style Bob, William Nelson)\n    &quot;Music for My Brother&quot; (William Nelson)\n    &quot;I've Been Alone&quot; (James Whipper, Melvin Glover, William Nelson, James Long)\n    &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; (James Whipper, William Nelson)\n    &quot;Don't Take Your Love From Me&quot; (William Nelson)\n    &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; (William Nelson, James Long)\n    &quot;Angie&quot; (James Whipper, William Nelson)\n\nBilly Bass Nelson - bass\nBernie Worrell - keyboards\nBilly Spruill - guitar\nBlake Smith - guitar\nSpacey T.
