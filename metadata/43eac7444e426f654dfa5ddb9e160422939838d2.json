An order of 100 episodes was later requested by TBSÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and on and on and on it continuedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThese are considered as test pilot episodes.  These episodes are somewhat different from the current series considering that Ella and Curtis were C.J.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s parents, instead of aunt and uncle as they are currently portrayed, and Calvin Payne didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist.  Demetria McKinney was not a primary cast member.\n\n------------------\n\nI got this from eB years ago and it was definitely originally recorded from television.  I had to dump it on my DVD Recorder (standard definition) and separate the episodes.\nAudio seems to be 2.0 ch (so says my encoder).\nOverall A/V is so so, but it is definitely watchable; and for lovers of the show it should be just fine or fair enough\n\n------------------\n\nClosed Captions are an option.\n\n------------------\n\nEps 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Roof Is On Fire (6/21/06)\nC.J.
