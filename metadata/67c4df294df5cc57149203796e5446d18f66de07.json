During excavations of the mass-graves in the 1920's, finds of major importance were made. Hundreds of skeletons - the remains of the hapless peasant militia - were found, together with mail shirts, coifs and 24 coats-of-plates. The finds gave important insights into the reality of Medieval warfare, as well as some extremely important discoveries of the development of transitional armor of the 14th century. So, what happened and why?\n\nBackground\nThe island of Gotland lies in the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Sweden. It was an important and well-situated link in the Baltic trade, and the city of Visby was a flourishing member of the Hanseatic League, the powerful medieval association of trading cities. The farmers of Gotland were wealthy, and not the stereotypical downtrodden peasants. The city and the farmers were at odds, though, and a civil war had been fought in 1288, a result from fights over trading rights and the erection of the 3-mile city wall. Gotland was a part of the Kingdom of Sweden, but it was pretty independent and could be considered an autonomous farmers republic, while the city of Visby was under the rule of the king of Sweden. The king was at the time of the battle Magnus Eriksson, whose kingdom was weakened after the Plague a dozen years earlier, from internal strife within the royal family, and from a debt-ridden economy. Meanwhile, the king of Denmark, Valdemar Atterdag, was on the rise. Denmark had suffered heavily from rebellions earlier in the century, where large parts of the kingdom had been gobbled up by German princes, and where the province of Scania (the southern part of modern-day Sweden) had been sold to Sweden. King Valdemar was set on restoring his kingdom, and he mounted several successful campaigns, one of which targeted a certain rich island in the BalticÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Battle\nThe Danish fleet approached Gotland from the south, having first attacked Ãƒâ€“land, another Swedish island. The Danes landed on the western coast of Gotland on the 22nd of July, 1361. The force consisted of Danish knights and German mercenaries. King Valdemar started the march northwards to Visby. The Danes were met by the peasant militia shortly afterwards, but beat them easily. Another battle took place in FjÃƒÂ¤le Marsh a few days later, which ended in another defeat for the Gotlanders. The farmers of Gotland were no pitchfork-wielding bumpkins. Every farmer was obliged by law to own mail-shirt, coif, helmet, shield, sword or axe, spear and bow or crossbow. Some of the equipment was probably worn and obsolete, having been passed down for generations, while arms like bows, crossbows and spears were mostly intoned for hunting. What they also lacked was training, especially against a professional, mounted force assisted by mercenaries. The two defeats must have sorely depleted the Gotlanders of men and arms, and morale must have been strained. Still, the force was probably reinforced by peasants from the north and east. Many of those were probably poorly armed, as every able man went forth to save the island. They fought for their independence, but bravery couldn't outweigh superior strength. The remaining Gotlanders retreated towards Visby, which was protected by the 30' wall. It is said that they pleaded for help from the city, or at least to be let in, but the burghers turned them down. The Gotlanders couldn't do anything apart from making a final stand. On the 27th of July, the farmers formed up just east of the city, on a field that came to be known as &quot;Korsbetingen&quot; (&quot;the Cross Meadow&quot;). It was a hot summer day. The Danes arrived soon afterwards and attacked with the same ruthlessness they had displayed in the earlier engagements. The farmers, maybe numbering a bit over 2,000 strong, had teen-agers and old men in their ranks, as well as some cripples and maybe even a few women. The skeletons found in the graves speak their own tales. First, there was a hailstorm of arrows and crossbow-bolts. The losses must have been significant; the powerful weapons of the attackers had greater range than the peasants' weapons. Then the Danish knights and footsoldiers fell on them. The skulls and bones found show how faces were cut open, arms and legs lopped off, heads crushedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ One peasant got both his shinbones cut off by a single powerful cut. Despite their desperate bravery, the Gotlanders were doomed. 1,800 of them fell that day in July while the townspeople watched on from the walls. Not resting on his victory, King Valdemar issued an ultimatum to the burghers - yield the city, or it will be razed. The burghers didn't want to lose their lives, so they gave in. A part of the city wall was torn down, and King Valdemar rode in triumph through the breach at the head of his forces. In less than a week, he had conquered the richest island in the Baltic. Outside the walls, a few surviving Gotlanders slipped away, while the Danes celebrated.\n\nThe Aftermath\nKing Valdemar levied a tax on the city, and the burghers were content - riches can be regained, but not lives. The king spent a month on the island before setting sail for Denmark. The dead was buried in at least five mass-graves. The hot weather had made a quick burial a necessity before putrefaction set in, increasing the risk for disease. Gotlanders and the few Danish dead were tossed into the same graves. The bodies must have been swollen, as many bodies were dumped together with their body-armor on. The excavations unearthed small glimpses from that fateful day. The customary plundering of the corpses was incomplete; a purse full of silver pennies was found by the archaeologists. The bones bore witness of the cruelty of war; a skull was pierced by three crossbow bolts fired from behind. Maybe some injured peasant was propped up for some target practiceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ One of the coats-of-plates bore small bronze escutcheons. Through heraldic armorials, the wearer has been identified as the younger son of a noble Frisian family. The man, having no hope for inheriting the fief, turned mercenary and was recruited for the campaign in the Baltic. Instead of finding his fortune, he found his grave together with hundreds of others. The loss of Gotland was the first of several blows that step by step impoverished the island, which was to see more invasions, changing hands several times before being finally reclaimed by Sweden. Still, the Gotlanders remember the battle, and they see themselves as Gotlanders first, Swedes second. Even today, some of the people in the countryside think the people of Visby betrayed them.\n\nThe Battlefield Today\nSome time after the battle, a convent was built at the site of the battle. A cross was erected, bearing an inscription in Latin: ANNO DOMINI MCCC LXI FERIA IIIA POST IACOBI ANTE PORTAS WISBY IN MANUIBUS DANORUM CECIDERUNT GUTENSES HIC SEPULTI ORATE PRO EIS (&quot;In the year of our Lord 1361 on the 27th of July in front of the gates of Visby fell the Gotlanders here buried in the hands of the Danes; pray for them.&quot;). Today, part of what is thought to be the battlefield is built upon, but a wide area outside the eastern part of the city wall is left open. Every year since 1984, there is a medieval festival on the island held in the beginning of August. One of the pageants is the entry by King Valdemar, who is mocked by the populace while his soldiers gather the burghers' riches. Myth and plays soften the trauma of 1361, but a visit to the county museum shows the facts behind it all. In glass cases, some of the sorry remains of the peasants are on display, together with some rusty mail and a few coats-of-plates. More can be seen in the Statens Historiska MusÃƒÂ©um in Stockholm, Sweden, and in the NationalmusÃƒÂ©et in Copenhagen, Denmark. Almost every book on medieval warfare or armor mentions the Battle of Visby, together with photos of coats-of-plates and a skull encased in a mail coif. Thus has a minor battle become known for a greater audience. I guess the Gotlanders could have lived without that claim to fame.\n\nSources\nCarlsson, Sten &amp; Jerker RosÃƒÂ©n: Den svenska historien, vol. 2 (1966)\nMedeltidens ABC (1985)\nNordberg, Michael: I kung Magnus tid (1995)\nThordeman, Bengt.
