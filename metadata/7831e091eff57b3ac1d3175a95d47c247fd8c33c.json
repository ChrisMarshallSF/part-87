He hadn't been playing, he'd been carrying \n\nmail.  He used to say, &quot;I don't think I can do it.  I haven't been playing enough.&quot;\n\nWell, it was the same way with Tal when he first came to work with me.  Tal used\n\nto quit every night.  He'd say, &quot;I can't play that fast.  I can't play like you do.\n\nI'm not used to playing in that tempo!&quot;  I said, &quot;Tal, as a trio, we don't have\n\ndrums or any volume control like that.  For loudness or softness we've got to use\n\nspeed as our main device.  To finish the set we've got to use pacing.&quot;&quot; .......\n\n......Red Norvo      (excerpted from included text)\n\n\nNOTE:  I've excluded the last 3 tracks because they are not of this trio...fA\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n\n\nMY CRITERIA FOR UPLOADS (in order of importance)\n\n\n1)  Is it duplication?\n\n2)  Do I love this &quot;album?&quot;\n\n3)  How good is the sound quality?\n\n4)  Does this music have interesting historical significance?\n\n\n\n\nWho has the time to listen to music which isn't extraordinary in some \n\nimportant way? ........fA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7831e091eff57b3ac1d3175a95d47c247fd8c33c","amp;dn":"RedNorvo%2CCharlesMingus%2CTalFarlow+trio%2FVJC+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7831e091eff57b3ac1d3175a95d47c247fd8c33c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,49,224,145,239,245,123,58,193,211,23,90,149,212,124,36,127,216,195,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
