The band's heavy guitar based sound is characterized by the creative use of the flute and unusual instruments like the Mellotron. Imagine a mix of BLACK SABBATH and early EAST OF EDEN, with a dash of JETHRO TULL. Band leader Thore Engen's lyrics have a mystical flair, and all the albums so far are part of a larger poetic cycle on the fall of the angel Lucifer.\n______________________________________________________\n\nyear: 2014\ngenre: heavy prog rock\nhard rock, heavy metal\ncountry: Norway\n\ntracklist:\n01.
