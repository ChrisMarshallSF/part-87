It has the same name as the CrÃƒÂ¼eÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1998 compilation, along with 13 of the same tracks, but the 2009 Greatest Hits is a different beast than its predecessor, weighing in at 19 tracks instead of 17 and sequenced chronologically instead of the year-skipping hodgepodge of 1998. These are all improvements, as are the swapping of a 1997 version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shout at the DevilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the original and the addition of the 1983 song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Young to Fall in Love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It features only the original line-up of Tommy Lee, Mick Mars, Vince Neil, and Nikki Sixx. Therefore, songs from the albums MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e and New Tattoo are not included, all helping to make this edition of the CrÃƒÂ¼eÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-recycled Greatest Hits their best comp yet. \n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
