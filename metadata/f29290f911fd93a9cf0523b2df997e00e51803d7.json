We're not going to give it     \n      away, but it involves dancing, papier mache and chickens. Joined by teammate Merrick\n      Watts, Crabb's Odd Sox take on The Help, Angus Sampson and Toby Schmitz. Other      \n      bonuses to look out for include: some very good reasons not to buy nail polish, the \n      world's most phallic building, the only English word with six z's in it, and the    \n      well-known phrase, 'Stop talking Four Eyes!'                                        \n   \n     Group Info  \n   \n      Our mission is to provide the scene with decent quality rips of old TV classics.\n   \n      Greets fly out to ARCHiViST, GERUDO, INQUISITION, RedBlade, REWARD, and everyone\n      that helped us; you know who you guys are!\n   \n      Looking for decent affil sites (no rented/colo) and rippers/cappers.\n   \n      Ask around for us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29290f911fd93a9cf0523b2df997e00e51803d7","amp;dn":"Randling.S01E16.DVDRip.x264-DEiMOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29290f911fd93a9cf0523b2df997e00e51803d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,146,144,249,17,253,147,169,207,5,35,178,223,153,126,0,229,24,3,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
