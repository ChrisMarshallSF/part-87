In 1961 he was imprisoned for 42 years (said to be the number of agents behind the iron curtain who were betrayed by him and later killed), at the time, the longest ever prison sentence in British history.\n\nIn 1966, he escaped from prison with the help of a previous cellmate,Sean Bourke and two others who believed Blake's sentence &quot;inhuman&quot;.
