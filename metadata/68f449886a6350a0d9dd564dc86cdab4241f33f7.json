In May 1998, a friend in the biz recommended him, and he finally got his shot. He was to be motorcycle thug #3 in a low budget action movie starring some Asian guy. Andy spent four months training and growing a moustache. His skillsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Impeccable. His lookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Perfection. \nThen came his big moment. A stunt in which Andy hits a ramp at moderate speed, jumps over exploding barrels while shooting a sub machine gun wildly in the air, and ultimately crashes harmlessly into a pile of cardboard boxes and trash. Instead of being nervous, Andy turned stupid brave with an extreme case of Fuck-It-All. This caused him to make some very poor and inexplicable decisions. \nWhen the director yelled for action, Andy took off and within seconds had reached a ridiculous speed of over 90 mph. To the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazement; Andy was wearing no helmet and was firing two handguns with real ammo instead of the sub machine gun loaded with blanks which sent bullets careening everywhere. Several lights popped and exploded from the stray gunfire, and the cinematographer slumped over as a bullet hit him in the thigh. Even with no hands steering the bike, Andy managed to pop the bike into a wheelie before hitting the ramp at incredible speed. The bike took off and the barrels exploded on cue into an awesome fireball. The explosion was so hot; it burned off half of AndyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moustache and sent him veering off course in an uncontrolled corkscrew.. He missed the landing zone by well over 300 feet and crashed into a stable of horses searing one completely in half. Somehow, Andy escaped with only minor injuries. He was labeled: &quot;'Reckless.&quot;... &quot;A loose cannon.&quot;... &quot;A disgrace.&quot; He and his shameful half-stache never worked in showbiz again.\n\nSupport the artist if you like it.\n \nSEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f449886a6350a0d9dd564dc86cdab4241f33f7","amp;dn":"Andy+Kehoe+Art+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f449886a6350a0d9dd564dc86cdab4241f33f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,244,73,136,106,99,80,160,217,221,86,77,200,108,218,180,36,31,51,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
