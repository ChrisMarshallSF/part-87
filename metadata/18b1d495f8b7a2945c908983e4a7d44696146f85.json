With her immediate family unable to watch over her, it's decided that she'll spend the summer with her Uncle John (Paul Lazar). Gena takes a part-time job at a beauty parlor and makes friends with a girl named Jane (Summer Phoenix). \n\nJane, however, is not a good influence; she's a recent runaway from a halfway house and is looking for her missing brother Sonny (Sam Rockwell), a convicted felon. When Jane disappears, Gena searches for her and is led into a netherworld of drugs, crime, gang violence, and sexual initiation. This independent drama was screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival; Heather Matarazzo of Welcome to the Dollhouse appears in a supporting role","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b1d495f8b7a2945c908983e4a7d44696146f85","amp;dn":"Arresting+Gena+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b1d495f8b7a2945c908983e4a7d44696146f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,177,212,149,248,183,162,148,92,144,137,131,228,167,212,70,150,20,111,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
