These guys have been around 5 years and just finally released their first 4 track EP last year. These guys were even nice enough to make this EP available for free download from a couple of sites. If these 4 tracks are any indicator as to what is to come from these guys in the future, I would say there is some potential here.\n\n\nQuote:\nNamed for wastewater containing bodily or other biological wastes. Formed and completed in fall of 2008, BLACKWATER from Kiel, Germany combines the fast grinding fury of Death Metal with modern influences and the gloomy atmosphere of Black Metal.\n\nAll members of BLACKWATER had played in other bands before which had been famous in the local metal scene or throughout whole Germany. Former bands (like MYRA, Full Speed Ahead, B.G.T., Gum-Hen, Infernal Disdain and Reprisal) had been used to develop and improve the technical skills and stage experiences of each member.\n\nThe band will continue to burn off stages and drown the masses in blackwater\n\nBand Members:\nRobert - Bass\nMichael Pfeffer - Drums\nFabian - Guitars, Vocals\nOskar - Guitars\nFlorian - Guitars\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n01.
