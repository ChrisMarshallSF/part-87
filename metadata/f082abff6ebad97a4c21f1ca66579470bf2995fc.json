A certain Chris Ducey\nwas originally slated to release an album on\nthe Mira offshot Surrey Records in 1965\nbut he dropped out due to Mira not being able\nto keep up their end legally. Mira had gone and\nprinted up the album covers and had the song\ntitles and songs but they could not use them.\nThe decided to go to the streets and farm\na naiive talented busker hollywood hippie type\nand lucked out with Bobby Jameson who was fresh\noff a bad trip with another record company in the UK\n(recording with the Rolling Stones) and right into\na boiling kettle of fate stew.\nHe got screwed over so bad, but the album is soo good.\nMany great black jazz / soul session musicians back him up on this album\nand Bobby sings for his life, going through various styles but still\nkeeping his theme needed to finish this project.\nJust after this he worked with Frank Zappa\ndid some soundtrack work and a few solo albums\nand an odd association with Rastus a band half way across the USA.\nFor in depth details and a chance to communicate with Bobby\nvisit one of his Blogs -\n\nHis story to this point is heart wrenching and worth it to investigate\nif you are under the impression hollywood and the music biz is something to waste your time with. \n\n\n\n____________________________\n\nDirect rip from commercial release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f082abff6ebad97a4c21f1ca66579470bf2995fc","amp;dn":"CHRIS+LUCEY-Songs+of+Protest+and+Anti+Protest-24K+ALAC+bobby+jam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f082abff6ebad97a4c21f1ca66579470bf2995fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,130,171,255,110,186,217,122,76,33,241,202,102,87,148,112,191,41,149,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
