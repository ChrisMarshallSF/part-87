Along the way he attempts to woo his ex-partner's sister (Barbara Payton) by threatening to expose her role in his escape.\nCotter quickly gets back into the crime business, only to be shaken down by corrupt local cops.\n\nFrom the trial of the survivors, we flash back to amoral crook Ralph Cotter's violent prison break, assisted by Holiday Carleton, sister of another prisoner...who doesn't make it. Soon Ralph manipulates the grieving Holiday into his arms, and two crooked cops follow her into his pocket. Ralph's total lack of scruple brings him great success in a series of robberies. But his easy conquest of gullible heiress Margaret Dobson proves more dangerous to him than any crime... \n\nCRITICAL RESPONSE:-\nThe film, often compared unfavorably to White Heat, received mixed reviews. Fred Camper, film critic for The Chicago Reader, called the film mis-directed, writing, &quot;Gordon Douglas's direction is almost incoherent compared to Raoul Walsh's in White Heat (1949), which features Cagney in a similar role; the compositions and camera movements, while momentarily effective, have little relationship to each other, and the film reads a bit like an orchestra playing without a conductor.&quot;\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz generally liked the film and wrote, &quot;This is an energetic straightforward crime drama based on the book by Horace McCoy (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and the screen play, which hardly makes sense and is the root of the film's problems, is by Harry Brown. Gordon M. Douglas (Come Fill the Cup/Only the Valiant) helms it by keeping it fast-paced, brutal and cynical, and lets star James Cagney pick up where he left off in the year earlier White Heat as an unsympathetic mad dog killer. This was an even tougher film, but the crowds didn't respond to it as favorably as they did to White Heat (which seems odd, since it's basically the same type of B-movie).&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 8320 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 102 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13d1254edf238bbd44803374e2ed278c66b7c46","amp;dn":"Kiss+Tomorrow+Goodbye+%281950%29+DVD9+-+James+Cagney%2C+Ward+Bond+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13d1254edf238bbd44803374e2ed278c66b7c46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,61,18,84,237,242,56,187,212,72,3,55,78,46,210,120,198,107,124,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
