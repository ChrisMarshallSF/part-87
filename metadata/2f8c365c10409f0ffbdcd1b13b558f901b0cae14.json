This films charts the work of Robert Watson Watt - the pioneer of Radar - and his hand-picked team of eccentric yet brilliant meteorologists as they struggle to turn the concept of Radar into a workable reality. Hamstrung by a tiny budget, seemingly insurmountable technical problems and even a spy in the camp, Watson Watt also has to deal with marital problems as he chases his dream. By 1939, Watson Watt and his team have developed the world's first Radar system along the south east coast of England. A system that, in 1940, proved pivotal in winning the Battle of Britain.              \n\nACTORS: \nEddie Izzard, Laura Fraser, Arran Tulloch, Lesley Harcourt, Alex Jennings, David Hayman, \n\nRELEASED: \n 23 June 2014 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3311900/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3311900/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 569788199 bytes (543.39 MiB), duration: 01:29:18, avg.bitrate: 851 kb/s\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x404, 25.00 fps(r) (eng)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=36563705934582458954.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=36563705934582458954.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=36352349367901843861.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=36352349367901843861.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=10290152648653915613.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=10290152648653915613.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : SONiDO\n Movie Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8c365c10409f0ffbdcd1b13b558f901b0cae14","amp;dn":"Castles+In+The+Sky+2014+BDRip+x264-SONiDO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8c365c10409f0ffbdcd1b13b558f901b0cae14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,140,54,92,16,64,159,15,251,220,209,177,59,85,143,144,27,12,174,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
