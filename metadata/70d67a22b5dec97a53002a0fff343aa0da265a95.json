Retelling the story of lawyer Raquel RodrÃƒÂ­guez's original investigation within the framework of a new legal intrigue, Nuevos Destinos is designed for courses in which less video and a specific pedagogical focus are needed.\n\nThese materials are useful for students in all of the following: intensive review and high beginner courses; intermediate grammar review courses; and intermediate courses in conversation and composition.\n\nProduced by WGBH Boston with McGraw-Hill. 2001. \n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Although the videos are flv, the quality is very high because it's directly from the &quot;source.&quot;\n\n2. I also have the high quality version of the original Destinos series.
