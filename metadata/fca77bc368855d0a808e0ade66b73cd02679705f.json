SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy Ward: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Someday PrettyÃ‚Â BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTamla T 54071 (A), August 1962\nb/w Part Time Love\n(Written by Berry Gordy and James Woodley)\n\nWith each successive chart hit Motown racked up in 1962, the writing must have been on the wall for Berry GordyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roster of blues and raw-edged R&amp;B artistes, who could only watch as Motown discs started landing in the upper echelons of the pop chart with increasing regularity. By late summer, Gino Parks, Herman Griffin, Popcorn Wylie and the excellently-named Henry Lumpkin were all already finished with the company, Hattie Littles had arrived too late and was seeing herself frozen out before sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d got started, Mable John kept in a holding pattern that saw her go 18 months between single releases. Yet Sammy Ward, the rawest and bluesiest of the lot, remained.\nSome of that apparent indulgence can be explained by the fact that Ward, unlike all the other aforementioned artists, had once landed Motown a hit record Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Fool reaching the R&amp;B Top 25 two years previously, only the fourth hit single for Motown on any chart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and so perhaps Gordy, simultaneously fiercely loyal and brutally hard-nosed, felt SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy had earned some patience.\nMy own theory, though, is that as a creator of fine blues records with limited pop appeal, Ward fit the bill perfectly when Berry Gordy felt Motown was in need of grounding, lest what was by now one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most significant black-owned music businesses somehow find itself accused of losing its Ã¢â‚¬Å“black identityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and risk losing the black audiences whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d got the company off the ground. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a line of argument that rears its head periodically throughout the Motown story, the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop success invariably leading to criticism from the black community that Motown was seemingly more concerned with chasing the dollars of white audiences than being a force for social change. Now, my own personal belief is that yes, that criticism was pretty accurate (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often been stated the only colour Berry Gordy cared about was green, hence him stocking the Motown front office with sales and admin talent without heed to race), but that Gordy was too shrewd an operator not to realise the value of his status, and his companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status Ã¢â‚¬â€œ however illusory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as an icon of black US culture that African-Americans could feel proud of, and the ensuing impact that could have on the bottom line.\nAs a result, whenever the balance of public opinion seemed to be advancing the criticism that Motown was somehow Ã¢â‚¬Å“not black enoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, whatever the hell that was supposed to mean, Gordy would find a way to address that criticism and reaffirm his credentials to an audience who werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buying a lot of copies of Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes Sing and Perform Funny Girl. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to suggest that Ward, or anyone else, was signed or kept on the books just to save face Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that would be an insult to a number of great artists. Rather, it simply confirms that Berry Gordy wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stupid, recognising that releasing strong product, quality stuff that nonetheless didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fly off the shelves and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t target the pop charts, had a value beyond nickels and dimes. (Plus, of course, you never knew when something might unpredictably hit out of nowhere; Jr Walker &amp; the All Stars landed more hits than most of MotownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ostensibly more commercial acts). Even when Gordy was hectoring his staff with memos stating Motown would henceforth only be releasing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Top Ten product on any artistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the Soul Records subsidiary carried on pushing the likes of Shorty Long and Earl Van Dyke. Reputation mattered.\nThis was SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy WardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixth Motown single, and however out of step Ward might have been with whatever else was going on at Hitsville at the time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a cracking record, a rollicking, hot-tempered midtempo number, virtually a cover of Bobby BlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Further On Up The Road polished up by Berry Gordy himself, resulting in a fine new concoction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sat astride the imaginary line that divides Ã¢â‚¬Å“R&amp;B-flavoured bluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“bluesy R&amp;BÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that demands to be turned up loud.\nRecorded less than a month before its release, this is the best thing SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy Ward ever cut, and that quick turnaround suggests everyone at Motown knew it. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a hit, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason why it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been.\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much nothing I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like about this, truth be told. From the atmospheric opening Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sammy doing his best melismatic acapella gospel while a small crowd whoops and hoots in recognition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to the bouncy, slinky rhythm bed that strikes up straight afterwards, with boogie-woogie piano, superb twangy blues guitar and driving horns, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a winning package. When Stevie Wonder shows up out of nowhere at 1:40 to give a coruscating harmonica solo (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yeah! Blow it, Steve!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the icing on the cake.\nSammy himself, meanwhile, is on electrifying form, dealing out his angry post-breakup monologue in raw, snarling fashion, spitting out an Ã¢â‚¬Å“offerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of reconciliation thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like an ultimatum, or even a guarantee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he knows his former girlfriend will come crawling back, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convinced this is no idle boast, but rather such a self-evident statement of fact that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crazy to even question it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hypnotic, and he sounds as though his face is scrunched up so tightly with feeling that he probably didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open his eyes once during the recording. (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why you laughing at me, baby? / I told you you shoulda been crying!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½)\nReally quite excellent. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t chart, but it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for a want of quality; I like to think Berry Gordy appreciated that. At Motown in 1962, even as other acts clocked up the hits, there was still room for SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy.\nVERDICT\n* * * * * * * * * *Ã¢â‚¬Â¨9 / 10\n(IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had MY say, now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your turn.

YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find THAT, in quality stereo too, on MotownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1969 vinyl complilation on the Soul label, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Switched On BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the album are not too difficult to find, certainly not cheap, but worth picking up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a few other surprises on it too, that I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go into right now. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also tempted to speculate that BG saw this as a potential Part 1 / Part 2 type of single initially, before letting it go with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Part Time LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as the B-side.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\t2.\t Dave L 9.12.10 / 5am God, I love your writting. You paint such vivid pictures with words I feel like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m right inside Motown studios in 1962 with Berry and this artist as they make their fateful decisions, and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what Sammy Ward looked like.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Sometimes weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve waited several days for the next entry, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve consistently rewarded the anticipation. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m already looking forward to this site entertaining me for years.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨This title too is one of those non-charters that I do own; not the 45, but the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Switched On BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ LP mentioned by the first commenter. In vinyl or CD, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right about its worth.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\t3.\t David Bell 9.12.10 / 8pm What I find even more surprising than the release of this 45 at a time when Berry Gordy was very conscious of turning a buck is that SinginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sammy was included on the Motown Revue tour later in 1962. I find it hard to imagine the mostly teenage, certainly young audienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaction to him compared to the reception that Mary Wells, the Vandellas, Marvin, the Marvelettes, the Miracles, the Supremes and so on must have received.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨It was only when I saw his photos in Curtis E WoodsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Memories of the 1962 Motown RevueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that I realised that he was on the show.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Woodson explained that nobody would believe that Sammy was on that tour when he told them about his career at Motown and that he had no photos of proof that he was there. But he was!Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n________________________________________________________________Ã¢â‚¬Â¨EFFECTS-NOISE SHAPING-REDUX\n\nRecorded flat-\n\nMinimal declick-denoise applied with CLICKREPAIR \n\nNO Effects applied\n\nNO Limiting/maximizing\n\n________________________________________________________________Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\nSaved to lossless .aiff CD ready files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca77bc368855d0a808e0ade66b73cd02679705f","amp;dn":"SWITCHED+ON+BLUES-motown-1969-stereo-CANADA-SS720-TAMLA+MOTOWN-L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca77bc368855d0a808e0ade66b73cd02679705f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,167,123,195,104,133,93,10,128,142,10,222,102,183,60,208,38,121,112,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
