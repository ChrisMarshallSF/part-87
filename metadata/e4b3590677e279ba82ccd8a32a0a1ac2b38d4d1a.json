Born around 1500, Soto left home at fourteen for Central America, where he rose through the ranks of the conquistadors to become a feared and effective captain, slave trader, and political operative. In 1531, he joined forces with Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of the Incas, leading the vanguard to Cuzco as Pizarro s second-in-command. Five years later, Soto returned to Spain with a thousand pounds of plundered treasure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4b3590677e279ba82ccd8a32a0a1ac2b38d4d1a","amp;dn":"Hernando+de+Soto+-+%28History+Exploration%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4b3590677e279ba82ccd8a32a0a1ac2b38d4d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,179,89,6,119,226,121,186,130,204,216,163,42,10,26,194,179,141,77,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
