Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. &quot;The order of the day,&quot; they wrote in their general statutes, &quot;is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.&quot;[1] The IlluminatiÃ¢â‚¬â€along with Freemasonry and other secret societiesÃ¢â‚¬â€were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\n\nIn subsequent use, &quot;Illuminati&quot; refers to various organisations which claim or are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are often alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, comics, video games, and music videos.\n\n\nDescription: These guys are PURE EVIL\n\nIlluminati\n\nIlluminati Freemason III New World Order  \nILLUMINATI's New World Order - Photos of EVIL\nShadow Government\nXtra's","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96631bb84f61d8e07a83c200b6169a57ac1308d","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+67+-+Illuminati+-+Freemasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96631bb84f61d8e07a83c200b6169a57ac1308d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,102,49,187,132,246,29,142,7,168,60,32,11,97,105,165,122,193,48,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
