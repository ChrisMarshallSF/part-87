FaiLED's recent caps     \n       are either mislabelled AHDTV, or from another source which       \n       everyone else must be missing out on (congrats if so).           \n                                                                        \n       Also a bit strange that they are MPEG2 audio - as AC3 must be    \n       used if available - and why would AC3 not be available on a      \n       platform which carries ITV2 HD?  A source sample will clear up   \n       the confusion...                                                 \n                                                                        \n       To tag as HDTV, rules state the release must be from a           \n       natively recorded transport stream and not the decoded output    \n       of a set-top box.. so please provide a RARd sample of your       \n       transport stream.                                                \n                                                                        \n       If it's AHDTV there's no shame in that but tag it correctly.     \n       We all know correct tagging is important, right? :)              \n                                                                        \n       Our release is from the repeat which aired on ITV1 HD            \n       unencrypted.                                                     \n                                                                        \n       For the nukers: source.sample.requested_suspected.AHDTV          \n                                                                      \n                                                                 \n                       We are looking for:                         \n                                                                  \n                      Our pants, clean socks                     \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                     Contact us if you can help!                 \n                                                               \n                                                         \n                \u0011 Shouts \u0010                    \n                                                       \n                                                             \n                    ANiVCD - SFM - WoW                       \n                     Centropy - Replica                          \n                      Razor1911                                 \n                      DMT                                       \n             of                      \n          Vision               ASCii by H*****/iND","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f292b42fd9de0cb5c2ede150a24db6be5f8f166","amp;dn":"The_Job_Lot.2x05.PROPER.HDTV_x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f292b42fd9de0cb5c2ede150a24db6be5f8f166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,41,43,66,253,157,224,203,92,46,222,21,10,36,219,107,229,248,241,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
