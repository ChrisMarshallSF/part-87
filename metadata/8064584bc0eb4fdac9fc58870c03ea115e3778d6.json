In turn, the later hires him on his farm in Shikhpur not knowing that Puran is deeply in love with his daughter. Then Neelu finds an injured male, who is later identified as Kamal, and they permit him to live with them. He recuperates and both Neelu and he fall in love much to the chagrin of Thakur Manohar who wants to wed her, and attempts to kill Kamal on two occasions. Bhairavdas wants the police to arrest Manohar, but before that could happen Kamal departs for Bombay, leaving a note for Neelu - clarifying that he is a convicted killer who is on the run from the law, but Neelu does not get to read this note, as Puran suppresses it. Neelu's health suffers, and she is diagnosed with thrombosis of the heart and must avoid any emotional involvement. Puran is then sent to Bombay to locate Kamal, and he does so.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 6405 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 1:52:21\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]     \nDuration: 112 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8064584bc0eb4fdac9fc58870c03ea115e3778d6","amp;dn":"Kinare+Kinare+%281963%29+MHCe+DVD5+-+Eng+Subs+-+Dev+Anand%2C+Meena+Kum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8064584bc0eb4fdac9fc58870c03ea115e3778d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,100,88,75,192,235,79,218,201,252,88,135,12,3,234,17,94,55,120,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
