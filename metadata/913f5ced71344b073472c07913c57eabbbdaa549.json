The crown prince (played by MGR) was on a sea journey and returns to attend the king's fake funeral. During the funeral, the crown prince comes to know the truth, via a secret message conveyed to him by the daughter (B.S.Saroja,in a bearded messenger disguise) of the palace physician. As expected, she falls in love with the prince. The sibling of king also plots to kill the prince by poisoning him with a drug, concocted by the palace physician. The drug was supposed to make the crown prince mad, who acts like a madman poisoned by the drug to fool everyone. Prince is also helped by a woman drama troupe leader (T.R.Rajakumari), who also had affection to the crown prince. Eventually, she sacrifices her life, leaving the prince to unite with the daughter of palace physician. The plotting villains were avenged by the prince and his comedian side kick (Chandrababu).\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1150 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Tamil\nRunTime: About 2 hours\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: About 120 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913f5ced71344b073472c07913c57eabbbdaa549","amp;dn":"Pudhumai+Pithan+%281957%29+Tamil+VCD+-+No+Subs+-+MGR%2C+TR+Rajakumari+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913f5ced71344b073472c07913c57eabbbdaa549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,63,92,237,113,52,75,7,52,114,192,121,19,197,126,171,187,218,165,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
