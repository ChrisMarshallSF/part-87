European Union member states agreed in July to take in more than 32,000 migrants to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ease the burdenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Italy and Greece, where the largest numbers have arrived. Another eight-thousand should be allocated by the end of the year, according to the European Union's commissioner for migration.\n\nStefan Molyneux is pissed off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and provides an important look at the European Migrant Crisis.\n\nFreedomain Radio is 100% funded by viewers like you.
