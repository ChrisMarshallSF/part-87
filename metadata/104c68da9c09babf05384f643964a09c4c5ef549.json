Oblivious to the danger, a group of hip students from all \nover the world, who now attend school together in New York, are planning \na memorial to celebrate the lives of their lost &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; \nwho died suddenly in a tragic plane crash a year prior. Aspiring actress \nEVE, her athletic boyfriend SEBASTIAN, bad boy gone good DOMINIC, tough \nbut sweet JOAN, hip hop mogul on the rise, VALENTINE and beautiful, \ncarefree MARIA, soon begin to turn up dead, one by one. As more dead \nbodies mount, detectives JOSEPH and MICHAEL are in a race against time \nto stop the serial killing. The crime scenes and the way each victim was \nkilled lead the detectives to theorize that each of the killings may be \nlinked to the victims' ancient namesakes. Those namesakes are known to \nbe some of the most saintly people that have graced the earth. As evidence \ncontinues to mount and more body bags are gathered, the detectives are \nconvinced that the killer is basing his crimes on the belief that every \ngeneration has 36 righteous individuals who live among us, where, with \nall of them gone, the world would fall into chaos, corruption and \neventual darkness. The hunt is on to find the last of the 36 Saints \nbefore the killer does. \n \n[color=red]Screenshots[/color]\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/sNpQE5e.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DIz7aBR.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/SyBZBJA.png[/img]\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/WIy1mCS.png[/img]\n\n[color=red][b]Greetz[/b][/color]\n\nTo all ;);)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104c68da9c09babf05384f643964a09c4c5ef549","amp;dn":"36+Saints+2013+WEBrip+XviD+AC3+MiLLENiUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104c68da9c09babf05384f643964a09c4c5ef549","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,76,104,218,156,9,186,191,5,56,79,100,57,100,160,156,76,94,245,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
