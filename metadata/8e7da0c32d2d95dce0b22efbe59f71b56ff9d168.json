They also issued an annual (what other kind is there?) calendar from (at least) the years 1972 through 1979 (as far as I can tell).  I remember my brother having one of these calendars when I was about 10 years old and thought it was the most hilarious thing ever.  I am still looking for a copy of the one that he used to have, I think it was 1975.
