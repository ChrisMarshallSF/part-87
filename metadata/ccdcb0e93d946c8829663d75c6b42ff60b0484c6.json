After many nights of vigil in the Carver railroad yard, he finally sees a spaceship land and discovers that an old rusted oil tanker contains alien machinery. He steals a computer tape from the tanker, and then goes immediately to Simon Carver's mansion in order to bring the old oil tycoon to the field. Unfortunately, the aliens have gotten rid of all evidence before he gets there. But David still has that computer tape. He enlists Neal Taft, a disgraced cryptographer, to find out what's on it. Meanwhile, Carver's daughter, Susan, finds herself torn between preventing a scandal for her father and betraying David, the man she loves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdcb0e93d946c8829663d75c6b42ff60b0484c6","amp;dn":"The+Invaders+Season+1+Ep.+12+-+The+Betrayed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdcb0e93d946c8829663d75c6b42ff60b0484c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,220,176,233,61,148,108,136,41,102,61,117,198,180,47,246,11,4,132,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
