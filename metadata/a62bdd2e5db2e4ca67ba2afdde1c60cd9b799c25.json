My idea of a full discography is all studio albums and compilation albums, and all soundtrack songs.  No bootlegs, etc. They are all MP3 VBR192.  They sound great. If you want better quality go elsewhere. Trolling will get you nowhere.  And they are FREE!  All nicely tagged, with artwork. That being said here is what you get:\n\nAerosmith\nGet Your Wings\nToys In The Attic\nRocks\nDraw The Line\nNight In The Ruts\nRock In A Hard Place\nDone With Mirrors\nPermanent Vacation\nPump\nGet A Grip\nNine Lives\nJust Push Play\nHonkin' A Bobo\nMusic From Another Dimension!\n\nThere is also a folder called other singles that have their soundtrack appearances in it which are:\n\nLove Me Two Times - Air America Soundtrack\nDeuces Are Wild - The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience\nAngel's Eye - Charlie's Angels Soundtrack\nI Don't Want To Miss A Thing - Armageddon Soundtrack\nWhat Kind Of Love Are You On - Armageddon Soundtrack\nSweet Emotion - Armageddon Soundtrack\nCome Together - Armageddon SOundtrack\n\nSo please enjoy, share and leave feedback!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62bdd2e5db2e4ca67ba2afdde1c60cd9b799c25","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62bdd2e5db2e4ca67ba2afdde1c60cd9b799c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,43,221,46,93,178,228,202,103,186,42,253,222,28,96,205,155,121,156,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
