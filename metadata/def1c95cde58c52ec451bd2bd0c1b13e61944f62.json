Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def1c95cde58c52ec451bd2bd0c1b13e61944f62","amp;dn":"CaptainStabbin+Mandy+Muse+Swimming+In+It+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def1c95cde58c52ec451bd2bd0c1b13e61944f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,241,201,92,222,88,197,46,196,81,189,43,208,193,177,62,97,148,79,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
