The 5 hour Quantum Rabbit Hole Edition\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonally I found this film changed my life when I first saw it almost\n10 years ago and it continues to have a palpable positive effect in the\nway I perceive my reality.\n\nOther people seem to this it's horse shit so whatever - take it or leave\nit!!\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\n* Disc 1 and Disc 2 of the Quantum Rabbit Hole Edition\n* The original theatrical version\n* All 20 interviews from Disc 4 and Disc 5\n\nAll discs ripped with MakeMKV and converted to mp4 with ffmpeg:\n\nVideo...........: x264 CRF 22\nProfile.........: High\nLevel...........: 4\nAudio...........: aac 192k\n\nThe video quality of the files is not an indication of a defect in my\nencoding process. The original DVD quality is just poor. It looks\nidentical when playing straight from the DVD.\n\nConstructive criticism welcome (Trolls, don't bother coming out from\nunder your bridge)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4290c042f3e7af0de715153149a0beebad9adca0","amp;dn":"What.the.Bleep.Extended.Quantum.Rabbit.Hole.Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4290c042f3e7af0de715153149a0beebad9adca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,144,192,66,243,231,175,13,231,21,21,49,73,160,190,235,173,154,220,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
