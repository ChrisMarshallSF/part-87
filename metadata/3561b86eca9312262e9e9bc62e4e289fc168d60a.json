This record has a lot of fascinating recordings, as it appears to have been used to advertise individuals for radio broadcast, television commercials, or other commercial venues. Noteworthy are people like J. P. McCarthy, who would become the morning man/interviewer for Detroit's own 760 AM (WJR). I would classify this record as more of a historical fascination than quintessential collection of songs; nonetheless, the difficulty in finding a copy worthy of a pursuing collector is extremely real. Here's a rip from a very clean copy, although there appears to be quite a bit of noise inherent in the record itself. \n\nWhat about that track A4? If you look at the cover and record, it's titled &quot;DO NOT PLAY&quot; - incredibly strange. On the vinyl itself, it's very evident that the pressing plate was actually scratched with &quot;X&quot;s all through this track, so that people would understand this message. Obviously, it was important not to have this individual promoted, or something. I risked it. So it's also included here, but at the necessary noise level introduced by the original pressing. There is also a small blip in B6 that is not on the original vinyl, but I had already sold the record by the time I noticed this, so we will have to live with it for now.\n\nEnjoy! It's unlikely you'll ever see a CD of this one ...\n\n\nFor updated information on this release, see the Discogs page at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3561b86eca9312262e9e9bc62e4e289fc168d60a","amp;dn":"Talent+Album+Number+One+%28Auditions%29+-+FLAC+48kHz%2F16bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3561b86eca9312262e9e9bc62e4e289fc168d60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,97,184,110,202,147,18,38,46,158,155,198,46,78,40,159,193,104,214,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
