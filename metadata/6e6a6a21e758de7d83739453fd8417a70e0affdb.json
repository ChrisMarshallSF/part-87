As they visited Indian reservations, Western boomtowns, remote ranches and local civic leaders, they confronted snowstorms, hunger, thieves and mountain lions with equal aplomb.\nTheir treacherous and inspirational journey to New York challenged contemporary notions of femininity and captured the public imagination.
