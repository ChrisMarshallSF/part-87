The British army, victorious, stands proudly to attention, ready to fight for honour and glory. At the head of his company stands Lieutenant Jack Steel, admired by his men, the finest infantry in Queen AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army. Much praised for his courage, his strength, and his loyalty, Steel has come to the attention of his Commander in Chief, the Duke of Marlborough.\nTasked with rescuing a letter whose controversial contents could destroy Marlborough, Steel leads his men against the French, in skirmishes that will culminate in the battle of Blenheim.\n\nRules Of War  [Jack Steel  02]\n\nRamilles 1706 was one of the great victories of the British army. But for Captain Jack Steel, standing at the head of his Grenadiers, and receiving contradictory orders, it was hard to see Lord MarlboroughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand stratagem. Far from the battle lines he enjoys, Jack Steel is sent undercover to identify the loyal locals who would help a few British advance troops into the besieged city Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a dangerous mission made deadly by his identification by an old enemy of his and the brilliant malevolence of the renegade French pirate who is in charge of Ostende.\n\n\nKeane's Company  [Keane  01]\n\nJames Keane, officer in the 27th Foot, card sharp, ladies' man and one of the finest but most rebellious soldiers in the British army, is under threat of court martial for disobeying Wellesley's strict rules. But his special, even ungentlemanly, skills have caught his general's eye, so he is selected to form a unique unit which will work behind enemy lines.\nKeane's next task is to hand-pick his band of men, some from prison for their aptitude at lock-picking and forgery as well as fighting skills, and form them into an effective unit before being sent on their first intelligence-gathering special mission, this time to link up with a lethal Spanish guerrilla leader.\nStealing into Oporto, Keane's men have to hold a vital post over the river a crossing against overwhelming forces, before being detached once more into the high mountains on another mission where the strains of the diverse characters of the unit test Keane's leadership skills to the uttermost.\n\n\nFour Days In June\n\nFour days in June, 1815. Three armies on the fields of Waterloo. A battle for honour, glory, civilisation. And two great leaders, Napoleon and Wellington, fighting directly for the first time to take their nations to victory.\nAs the battle develops it is seen through the very different positions and characters of the front men. Colonel De Lancey, Wellington's new Quartermaster-General, recently married and yearning for his beautiful wife; Colonel MacDonnell, a Scot who must hold his post to the last man; General Ziethen of the Prussian army, distrustful of the British but vital to their cause; Marshal Ney, mistrusted by Napoleon but revered by the French soldiers; and Napoleon, who must prove his worth as a great warrior for the glory of France. Wars are won by the men who lead them. This is the story of those men's strengths, their courage, their thoughts and their fears from the eve of battle to its bloody conclusion.\n\nThe Black Jackals  [Peter Lamb  01]\n\nThe start of a brand new WWII series from Iain Gale, author of Alamein.\nA masterly portrayal of World War Two heroism, with vivid action and stirring personal journeys.\nA small team of soldiers, left behind to cover the British retreat, are ordered to blow the bridge as late as possible to stem the German tank pursuit. Although successful, the operation kills desperate refugees fleeing the scene. Who will be made to face the court-martial: the men carrying out the orders or their commanding officer?\nThis is only the first of many dilemmas that Peter Lamb and his troop must face during the chaotic first months of World War Two. After becoming cut off from the rest of their regiment, and assigned a mission that takes them deep into France behind the fast-moving enemy lines, the cracks begin to appear.\nIn these unexpected, tense circumstances, Lamb's men face internal struggles, taking their focus off both their French allies and the German enemy.\nThe Black Jackals shows how men react to the challenges of war, and gives a fresh and fascinating picture of the front lines.\n\nJackals' Revenge  [Peter Lamb  02]\n\n1941, and the Brits are struggling to hold their line in Greece against the German and Italian forces. Peter Lamb and his men are halted in their retreat and forced to join the British forces holding the pass at Thermopylae. But their tough experiences in France have not prepared them for the savage hand-tohand fighting through the mountains. When they land in Crete, Lamb becomes suspicious of some of the civilians who have taken cover with the Jackals. Yet he knows that facing the German paratroopers, combined with the battle to hold Crete at all costs, will force him to find a way to work alongside any support he is offered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b005d89268249dab1442e254e160727c925250","amp;dn":"Iain+Gale+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b005d89268249dab1442e254e160727c925250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,176,5,216,146,104,36,157,171,20,66,226,84,225,96,114,124,146,82,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
