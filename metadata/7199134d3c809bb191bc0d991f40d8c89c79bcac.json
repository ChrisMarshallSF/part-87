The term is also used in a generic sense to refer to any end of the world scenario.\n\nThe word &quot;Armageddon&quot; appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16. The word is translated to Greek from Hebrew har mÃ‰â„¢giddÃƒÂ´ (Ã—â€Ã—Â¨ Ã—Å¾Ã—â€™Ã—â„¢Ã—â€œÃ—â€¢), har - Strong H2022 - meaning &quot;a mountain or range of hills (sometimes used figuratively): - hill (country), mount (-ain), X promotion.&quot; This is a shortened form of Harar - Strong H2042 - &quot;to loom up; a mountain; -hill, mount&quot;. Megiddo - Strong Ã—Å¾Ã–Â°Ã—â€™Ã–Â´Ã—â€œÃ–Â¼Ã—â€¢Ã–Â¹Ã—Å¸ H4023 /meg-id-do'/ &quot;Megiddon or Megiddo, a place of crowds.&quot;)[4] &quot;Mount&quot; Tel Megiddo is not actually a mountain, but a tell (a hill created by many generations of people living and rebuilding on the same spot)[5] on which ancient forts were built to guard the Via Maris, an ancient trade route linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Megiddo was the location of various ancient battles, including one in the 15th century BC and one in 609 BC. Modern Megiddo is a town approximately 25 miles (40 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee in the Kishon River area.[6]\n\nAccording to one premillennial Christian interpretation, Jesus will return to earth and defeat the Antichrist (the &quot;beast&quot;), the False Prophet and Satan the Devil in the Battle of Armageddon. Then Satan will be put into the &quot;bottomless pit&quot; or abyss for 1,000 years, known as the Millennium. After being released from the abyss, Satan will gather Gog and Magog from the four corners of the earth. They will encamp surrounding the &quot;holy ones&quot; and the &quot;beloved city&quot; (this refers to Jerusalem). Fire will come down from God, out of heaven and devour Gog and Magog. The Devil, death, hell, and those not found written in the Book of Life are then thrown into Gehenna (the lake of fire burning with brimstone).[7]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7199134d3c809bb191bc0d991f40d8c89c79bcac","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+68+-+Countdown+to+Armageddon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7199134d3c809bb191bc0d991f40d8c89c79bcac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,153,19,77,60,128,155,177,145,188,13,153,31,64,216,200,156,121,188,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
