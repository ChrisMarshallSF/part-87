That's why for the people of Detroit, the go-to pawn shop for more than four decades has been American Jewelry and Loan. This series follows its day-to-day operations, focusing on third-generation pawnbroker and company patriarch Les Gold, a street-smart old-schooler known for driving a hard bargain but having a soft heart. The family business also includes Seth, Les' only son and business partner; daughter Ashley, the shop's general manager; and Les' wife, Lili. But there's no question who the boss is, and he's often heard reminding his team of more than 45 employees, &quot;The customer always lies.&quot;\n\nStarring:\nLes Gold\nAshley Broad\nSeth Gold\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1674417/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1674417/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed when finished so that other people may enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3694659ca28f77f2275c7f465efbf064cac957","amp;dn":"Hardcore+Pawn+Season+1-8+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3694659ca28f77f2275c7f465efbf064cac957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,54,148,101,156,162,143,119,242,39,92,127,70,94,251,240,100,202,201,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
