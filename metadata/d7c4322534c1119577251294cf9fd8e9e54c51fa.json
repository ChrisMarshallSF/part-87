The show adopts an informal production style where production mistakes and tomfoolery, mostly instigated by O'Carroll, are edited into each episode. \n\nAfter being lambasted by critics, the show has become a ratings success in both Ireland, where it is set, and the United Kingdom, where it is recorded. It is also gaining increasingly higher ratings in Australia and Canada. Subsequently in 2012 it won three television comedy awards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c4322534c1119577251294cf9fd8e9e54c51fa","amp;dn":"Mrs+Brown%27s+Boy%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c4322534c1119577251294cf9fd8e9e54c51fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,196,50,37,52,193,17,149,119,37,18,148,207,159,216,233,229,76,81,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
