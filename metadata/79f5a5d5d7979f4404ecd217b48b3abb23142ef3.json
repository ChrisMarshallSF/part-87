Created by Irish comedy troupe Diet of Worms with Father Ted writer Graham Linehan\n \n \n \nThe Walshes are a warm, tight-knit family from the West Dublin suburb of Strollinstown. But sometimes tight-knit is too much, and the Walshes are tripping over each other as the kids out-grow the family home.\n\n Tony, head of the household, tells the sort of Dad jokes that most people would cross continents to avoid; his wife Carmel is the typical Irish Mammy, and they're parents to Ciara and Rory, both still living at home because the state of the Irish economy has forced them all back together.\n\n Even Ciara's new boyfriend Graham is forced to move in and family friend Martin always seems to be hanging around mending bits and pieces - as well as accidentally becoming trapped in the wall cavity.\n\n The script has been developed by comedy group Diet Of Worms in collaboration with Graham Linehan. The characters are based on The Taste Of Home, a low-budget web series created by the comedy group in 2010. \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_walshes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_walshes/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nThe Walshes - S01 - E01 - Doctor Burger \nThe Walshes - S01 - E02 - Family Night\nThe Walshes - S01 - E03 - Limbo\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : The Walshes.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 24s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 664 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 24s\nBitrate                     : 1 548 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.207\nStream size                 : 326 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 29mn 24s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 103 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 21.6 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 527 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f5a5d5d7979f4404ecd217b48b3abb23142ef3","amp;dn":"The+Walshes+-+S01+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f5a5d5d7979f4404ecd217b48b3abb23142ef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,245,165,213,215,151,159,68,4,236,210,23,180,139,58,187,35,20,46,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
