Ant talks about a shooting in Canada, people lacking a sense of humor on Twitter, the official autopsy report for Michael Brown, and a three-on-one attack video that oddly has no outrage. We watch a convenience store robbery video, KtC shows Ant Boy Pussy, the callers then join in with Ant to ridicule KtC for showing everyone a heaping helping of gay, we then see a fucking pro-feminism video, and hear from new sponsor, ADailyMinute.com. Anthony moves to the couch to talk with Jade Vixen about latex, vacuum beds, dressing up for sex, and how Bobo stood Jade up. Big A joins the couch to get a lap dance from Jade, we learn about the zombie fleshlight, and Big A gets some alone time with Jade while attempting to try out this new product","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdfbd52346c225c9d92bbc2cb094a173cdcfa088","amp;dn":"2014-10-22.The+Anthony+Cumia+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdfbd52346c225c9d92bbc2cb094a173cdcfa088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,251,213,35,70,194,37,201,217,43,188,44,176,148,161,115,205,207,160,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
