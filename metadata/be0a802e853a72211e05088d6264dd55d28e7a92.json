The growing popularity of dinner clubs and themed potlucks attest to our desire for get-togethers at home that are out of the ordinary; also, temporary pop-ups and secret supper locales (where the address is often kept under wraps) are redefining the notion of the traditional restaurant meal. But where do vegans fit into all this fun for foodies?\n\nVegan Secret Supper is a collection of imaginative, delectable, animal-free recipes by chef MÃƒÂ©rida Anderson of VSS (Vegan Secret Supper), a dining club that she has run in Vancouver, Montreal, and New York. At VSS, MÃƒÂ©rida creates amazing vegan dishes that prove that sophisticated, spectacular dinner parties do not require the use of animal products. With her focus on menu-planning and simple, seasonal ingredients, she offers readers all the tools they need to create healthy, sumptuous meals, whether it's a dish for a potluck, a romantic dinner for two, or a celebration for twenty.\n\nFull-color throughout, the book's recipes include split pea bisque with minted cream; smoked cauliflower on red quinoa tabouli; walnut and roasted yam croquettes with spicy balsamic beet reduction; and chocolate blackberry cashew cheesecake. As well, MÃƒÂ©rida offers fantastic tips and insight on how to create your own vegan secret supper club at home.\n\nMÃƒÂ©rida Anderson is a self-taught chef who became vegan at the age of sixteen. She is also a photographer, visual artist, clothing designer, and musician","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0a802e853a72211e05088d6264dd55d28e7a92","amp;dn":"Vegan+Secret+Supper...-Merida+Anderson.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0a802e853a72211e05088d6264dd55d28e7a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,10,128,46,133,58,114,33,30,5,8,141,98,100,221,85,210,142,122,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
