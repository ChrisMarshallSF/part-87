All three videos appear to be well-produced, with good quality sound and lighting.\n\nCantlie described himself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“long-term prisonerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and went on to criticise US president Barack ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy for air strikes to defeat IS fighters.\n\nEpisode 1 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11131269/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11131269/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 2 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11132694/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11132694/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode 3 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11199218/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11199218/Lend_Me_Your_Ears_-_Episode_3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6044f61b686ab9e2cb18faf3e839a5469eb2c9","amp;dn":"Lend+Me+Your+Ears+-+Episode+4.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6044f61b686ab9e2cb18faf3e839a5469eb2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,96,68,246,27,104,106,185,226,203,24,250,243,232,57,165,70,158,178,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
