He has a dysfunctional marriage to &quot;she who must be obeyed&quot; and a rather tenuous one with Nick, his only son, who has always believed his father cares more for the Bailey than him. Although Nick is scheduled to leave for college in America, Rumpole opts to defend a Jamaican teenager who has apparently confessed to randomly stabbing a pedestrian at a bus stop after a cricket match. Nick does stop by the courthouse to have lunch with his father and try establish communication with him before he leaves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e56d7a5694de05113b9479a85770089d9d647bd","amp;dn":"S01E00+Rumpole+of+the+Bailey+-+Pilot.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e56d7a5694de05113b9479a85770089d9d647bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,86,215,165,105,77,224,81,19,185,71,154,133,119,0,137,217,214,71,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
