Rayudu lives with his wife (Meena Kumari) and two daughters Visalakshi (Madhumitha) and Jagadha (Deeksha Seth) in a small house beside the Mahal. Rayudu rents out the palace to make ends meet. He is shown as a soft and generous man. Some of the tenants take this generosity for granted and harass Rayudu, without paying the rent.\n\nInto this scenario comes Manoj (Manoj Manchu), as someone seeking a place to rent. He slowly gets rid of the problematic elements in the palace and restores control to Rayudu. Manoj falls in love with Jagadha. A happy Rayudu decides to get Visalakshi married and decides to give away the Gandharva Mahal as dowry. One night, Manoj comes to Rayudu with a bloodied nose and claims that he saw a ghost which tried to kill him and warned him about selling the Mahal. Rayudu reveals that the ghost might be his dead father, Rudramaneni Narsimha Rayudu (Nandamuri Balakrishna) and explains the history of Gandharva Mahal to Manoj.\n\nGandhrva Mahal has been with the Rudramaneni family for centuries and was passed on to Narasimha Rayudu (Nandamuri Balakrishna), a Zamindar who is well respected in the village. He lives with his wife (Panchi Bora) and sister Jagadamba (Simer Motiani). He marries his sister Jagadamba to Phanindra Bhoopati (Sonu Sood). Few days after the marriage, Bhoopati insults Narsimha Rayudu and asks him to give their share in the family property. Deeply hurt by the incident, Narsimha Rayudu gives half of everything he owns including the Gandharva Mahal to his sister and walks out of the house. He also gives hundred acres of land to Seshayya (Bhanu Chander), his trusted employee and friend. It is later revealed that Bhoopati married Jagadamba only for the money and wants to marry his sweetheart Amrutha Valli (Lakshmi Manchu). Amrutha doesn't want to marry Bhoopathi since he already has a wife. Consequently, Bhoopathi kills Jagadamba and makes it look like a suicide.\n\nOn hearing the news, Narasimha Rayudu is devastated. Only a week after Jagadamba's death, Bhoopathi tries to marry Amrutha in the Gandhrva Mahal. Narasimha Rayudu, angered by Bhoopathi's actions, confronts him. Bhoopathi gets into a fight with Narasimha Rayudu and stabs him with a sword. He also reveals to Amrutha and the dying Narasimha Rayudu that he was the one who murdered Jagadamba. In anger, Narasimha Rayudu kills Bhoopathi and dies in the Mahal. Amrutha, saddened by the events, blames herself for the whole incident and eventually turns into a beggar.\n\nIn the present, Gandharva Mahal is readied for the marriage of Visalakshi. The bridegroom Rishi (Richard Rishi) and his family arrive for the wedding. It is revealed that Rishi's uncle Bujji (Sai Kumar) wants to take the palace and convert it into a hotel. Later that night, Bujji sees Narasimha Rayudu's ghost and gets scared. Bujji seeks the help of a Mantrik (Ajay) who reveals that the house is indeed haunted by the souls of Bhoopati and Narasimha Rayudu. He captures the violent soul of Bhoopathi and traps it in a bottle. It is also revealed that Manoj is Seshayya's grandson and was sent by his mother Suguna (Suhasini Maniratnam), Seshayya's daughter to help Rayudu and his family. Manoj reveals to Jagadha that he was never attacked by a ghost and tells her it was part of his plan to avoid giving the Mahal as dowry. He also reveals that it was not a ghost but him that scared Bujji. Bujji overhears the conversation and is angered. Believing that the Mantrik too was a fraud, in anger he breaks the bottle in which the Mantrik captured Bhoopati's soul. Now freed, Bhoopathi's soul enters Rishi's body and tries to kill the family. Narasimha Rayudu's soul enters Manoj's body and tries to stop Bhoopathi. Mantrik brings Anrutha Valli to stop Bhoopathi. Amrutha Valli lies to Bhoopathi that she got married and kills herself to stop him. In the end, Visalakshi marries Rishi and Manoj gets married to Jagadha. Manoj also sees the ghost of Narsimha Rayudu sitting on a chair and smoking a cigar, indicating that he would forever protect the Mahal.\nCast\n\n    Balakrishna as Rudramaneni Narasimha Rayudu\n    Manoj Manchu as Manoj\n    Deeksha Seth as Jagadhamba\n    Lakshmi Manchu as Amrutha Valli\n    Sonu Sood as Phanindra Bhoopati\n    Prabhu as Rayudu\n    Richard Rishi as Rishi Kumar\n    Bhanu Chander as Seshayya\n    Sai Kumar as Bujji\n    Dharmavarapu Subramanyam as Utsava Murthy\n    Pruthvi Raj as Siddha\n    Ajay as Mantrik\n    Raghu Babu as Nerala Satti Babu\n    Raja Ravindra as Doctor\n    Prabhas Sreenu as Cable Keshav\n    Praveen as Lavudu\n    Nizhalgal Ravi as Manoj's father\n    Gollapudi Maruti Rao as Venkat Rao\n    Chalapathi Rao as Raja Rao\n    Panchi Bora as Visalakshi (Narasimha Rayudu's wife)\n    Simer Motiani as Jagadamba\n    Suhasini as Suguna\n    Aishwarya as Rajyalakshmi\n    Abhinayashree as Golla Savitri\n    Madhumitha as Vishalakshi\n    Meena Kumari as Jagadha's mother\n    Prabha as Rishi Kumar's mother\n    Ragini as Utsava Murthy's wife\n\nMedia Info\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                        : 221030484400998065060917746769374172807 (0xA648EC40189E01FAB79A7F94EE5F5687)\nComplete name                    : E:Uu Kodathara Ulikki Padathara (2012) [Simha 2 2014] Hindi Dubbed 720p WEBRip 900MB [SReeJoN]Uu Kodathara Ulikki Padathara (2012) [Simha 2 2014] Hindi Dubbed 720p WEBRip 900MB [SReeJoN].mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 914 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 57mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 085 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2014-12-05 05:08:26\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v6.1.0 ('Old Devil') built on Mar  2 2013 14:32:37\nWriting library                  : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
