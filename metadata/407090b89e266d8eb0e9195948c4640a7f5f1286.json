At the last second, Zabuza is seemingly killed by a young masked hunter ninja from the Hidden Mist Village. Naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave Team 7 so much trouble, but Kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than Naruto yet stronger than himself. The hunter-nin leaves with Zabuza's body, and Kakashi then collapses from fatigue as a result of using his Sharingan for too long","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:407090b89e266d8eb0e9195948c4640a7f5f1286","amp;dn":"Naruto+Episode+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"407090b89e266d8eb0e9195948c4640a7f5f1286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,112,144,184,158,38,109,142,176,233,25,89,72,196,100,10,127,95,18,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
