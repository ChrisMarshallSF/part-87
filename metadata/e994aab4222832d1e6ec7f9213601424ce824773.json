Veerappa) estimates to have committed a terrible fault and commits suicide to repair her, not without having indicated his successor : Vijayan (MGR), a man of the people, that one even, who had come punish him, a fearless knight, for a big bravery.\nBefore dying, he (P. S. Veerappa) also orders him (MGR) to protect his subjects and to put back the power in the hands of the people.\nSo by acting, the deceased king had also just thwarted the machiavellian intentions of its Minister (R. S. Manohar).\nIndeed, this traitor intends to seize the throne.\nBut it will be for another time, because this sinister dignitary (R. S. Manohar) is going to make every effort to put sticks in wheels in the reforms of Vijayan.\nTo begin by eliminating him...\n\nARASA KATTALAI is magnificent one cape and of sword realized by the own older brother of MGR, M. G. Chakrapani and produced by his son, M. C. Ramamoorthy, under The Sathiyaraja Pictures.\nThis movie gathers for unique time, two bigger and more important feminine partners of MGR, worth knowing, B. Saroja Devi (25 movies with MGR) and Jayalalitha (28 movies with MGR). A very beautiful poster in prospect...\nTheir respective title in the movie, for B. Saroja Devi, &quot;Abinaya Saraswathi&quot; and for Jayalalitha, &quot;Kavarchi Kanni&quot; (after &quot;Kalai Selvi&quot;).\nIt is the last movie of MGR with the big actress B. Saroja Devi.\nIn a way, B. Saroja Devi crosses the relay to Jayalalitha.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1154 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Tamil\nRunTime: 2:39:57\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: 2:39:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e994aab4222832d1e6ec7f9213601424ce824773","amp;dn":"Arasa+Kattali+%281967%29+Tamil+VCD+-+No+Subs%2C+MGR%2C+B.Saroja+Devi+%5BDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e994aab4222832d1e6ec7f9213601424ce824773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,148,170,180,34,40,50,209,230,236,127,146,19,96,20,36,206,130,71,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
