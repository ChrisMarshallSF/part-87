It includes basic topics like non-stationary panels, co-integration in panels, multifactor panel models, panel unit roots, measurement error in panels, incidental parameters and dynamic panels, spatial panels, nonparametric panel data, random coefficients, treatment effects, sample selection, count panel data, limited dependent variable panel models, unbalanced panel models with interactive effects and influential observations in panel data. Contributors to the Handbook explore applications of panel data to a wide range of topics in economics, including health, labor, marketing, trade, productivity, and macro applications in panels.\n\nThis Handbook is an informative and comprehensive guide for both those who are relatively new to the field and for those wishing to extend their knowledge to the frontier. It is a trusted and definitive source on panel data, having been edited by Professor Badi Baltagi-widely recognized as one of the foremost econometricians in the area of panel data econometrics. Professor Baltagi has successfully recruited an all-star cast of experts for each of the well-chosen topics in the Handbook.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Oxford Handbooks\nPDF: 705 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press (December 1, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199940045\nISBN-13: 978-0199940042\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddd456a3c036ec52618d268ae1144b769cc1f8a4","amp;dn":"The+Oxford+Handbook+of+Panel+Data+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddd456a3c036ec52618d268ae1144b769cc1f8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,212,86,163,192,54,236,82,97,141,38,138,225,20,75,118,156,193,248,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
