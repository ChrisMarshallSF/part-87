Dave Mustaine's reversed are MD and Lee Ving's are VL which is 45 in Roman numerals hence the name MD.45&quot;,[1] although 45 is more properly represented in Roman numerals as XLV, acknowledged in a later answer.[2] The initials also stand for members of the band: Mustaine, DeGrasso, Ving and LeMieux.\n\nThe first (and only) album released was The Craving in Japan first on May 29, 1996 and in other nations on July 23, 1996. According to the album's liner notes, The Creed was originally a Megadeth demo song, which is on the 2004 remastered edition of the album.\n\nThought I would upload the hard to find original album.\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69997e4187f4c6d502e4cc68c8951d1bc933c2eb","amp;dn":"MD.45+-+The+Craving+%28Original+Version%29++Megadeth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69997e4187f4c6d502e4cc68c8951d1bc933c2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,153,126,65,135,244,198,213,2,228,204,104,200,149,29,27,201,51,194,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
