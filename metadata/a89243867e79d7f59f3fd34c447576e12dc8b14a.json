My idea of a full discography is all studio albums and compilation albums, and all soundtrack songs.  No bootlegs, etc. They are all MP3 VBR192.  They sound great. If you want better quality go elsewhere. Trolling will get you nowhere.  And they are FREE!  All nicely tagged, with artwork. That being said here is what you get:\n\nThe Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\nA Saucerful Of Secrets\nMore\nUmmagumma\nAtom Heart Mother\nMettle\nObscured By Clouds\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon\nWish You Were Here\nAnimals\nThe Wall\nThe Final Cut\nA Momentary apse Of Reason\nThe Division Bell\nThe Endless River\n\nA note about the The Dark Side Of The Moon.  I combined the tracks Brain Damage/Eclipse and Speak To Me/Breathe. THose tracks should always be played together in my opinion.  Some will like it some not so much.  It is what it is.\n\nSo please enjoy, share and leave feedback!\n\nWhile your at it...check out the new leader in Fantasy Sports!!!!   Baseball, football, hockey, basketball and more!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.fanduel.com/?invitedby=decypher&amp;cnl=da&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.fanduel.com/?invitedby=decypher&amp;cnl=da&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89243867e79d7f59f3fd34c447576e12dc8b14a","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+Discogrphy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89243867e79d7f59f3fd34c447576e12dc8b14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,146,67,134,126,121,215,245,159,63,211,76,68,117,118,225,45,200,177,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
