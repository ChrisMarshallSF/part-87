Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to stop them.\n\nThree months have passed since the fateful encounter in New York City that ended with the disappearance of Bill Ryder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ gamer, geek, and legendary vampire. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ reawakened halfway across the globe with no allies, clothing, or clue as to how he got there. The only thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain of is that his captors plan to use him for their own nefarious ends and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care how much blood they spill in the process.\n\nEscape might be the least of his worries, though. Civilization teeters on the brink of chaos. Mythical beasts, once thought the stuff of fantasy, are breaking through the veil, intent on waging war against mankind. At their forefront stands an ancient evil, the last remnant of a people thought long dead, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to cut a swath of destruction through the world not seen since biblical times.\n\nBillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only chance is to reclaim his life, reconcile with his friends, and muster every bit of attitude he can Ã¢â‚¬â€œ because if he fails, Hell on Earth will become far more than just a corny saying.\n\n\n\nfor more ebooks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cuzbook.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cuzbook.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c28d185fa509dcea3c4326e00708f2affef7226","amp;dn":"Goddamned+Freaky+Monsters+%28The+Tome+of+Bill+%235%29+%26ndash%3B+Rick+Gua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c28d185fa509dcea3c4326e00708f2affef7226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,40,209,133,250,80,157,206,163,196,50,110,0,112,143,42,255,239,114,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
