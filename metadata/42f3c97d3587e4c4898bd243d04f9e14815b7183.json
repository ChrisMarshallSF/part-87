Ultimately, the film belongs to its main man and leading lady, who show in their first significant screen pairing that they are good at generating laughter and drama in equal measure.\n\nNick Cheung Ka-Fai plays Lung, a property agent told by his air stewardess girlfriend Julie (Myolie Wu Hang-yee) that she will only marry him if they can live as a couple in a 1,000 sq ft flat on Tai Hang Road within a year of his having proposed to her. In desperation, he concocts a scheme that sees him become co-owner of a luxury penthouse from which he hopes to turn a quick profit.\n\nOf the property's three other co-owners, working-class girl Hak (Angelababy Yeung Wing) decides to be part of the deal because she trusts Lung, the closest thing to a father in her life. Very Wong (Oho Ou Hao) is a gullible rich mainland colleague of Lung's, eager to show his wealthy dad that he can make money too. Charlotte (Sammi Cheng Sau-man) is an unhappy recent divorcee who Lung turned from potential client into fellow property speculator.\n\nAlthough they have little in common they end up having to live together for a time Ã¢â‚¬â€ as a de facto temporary family Ã¢â‚¬â€ after the property market cools down considerably as a result of anti-speculation measures put into effect by the government.\n\nPerhaps because they are hard at work at their jobs, Hak and Very don't spend much time in the flat Ã¢â‚¬â€ and therefore don't have much screen time together.\n\nMore attention is given instead to Charlotte, who still harbours hopes of reuniting with her husband of 10 years for whom she previously had sacrificed much, and may well be the character who best understands what is needed to turn a place of residence into a real home.\n\nOccasionally, the audience is given hints that the film aims for some emotional and intellectual depth, mostly by way of assorted asides tossed out on what really matters in life.\n\nToo often, however, it seems like the preference is to settle for focusing on what's on the surface of a film whose visuals are indeed a highlight, thanks to Charlie Lam Chi-kin's beautiful cinematography.\n\n\n\nCAST:\nSammi Cheng, Nick Cheung, Ines Laimins\n\n\nRELEASE: 21 August 2014\n\n\niNFO:\nSize: 635904216 bytes (606.45 MiB), duration: 01:39:28, avg.bitrate: 852 kb/s\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz, stereo (chi)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x302, 24.00 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=13017437449644377441.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=13017437449644377441.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=55570765709248310748.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=55570765709248310748.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=24463381052533381007.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=24463381052533381007.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=09379556024141038794.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lexiit.com/viewer.php?file=09379556024141038794.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f3c97d3587e4c4898bd243d04f9e14815b7183","amp;dn":"Temporary.Family.2014.BDRip.x264-ROVERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f3c97d3587e4c4898bd243d04f9e14815b7183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,243,201,125,53,135,228,196,137,139,210,67,208,79,158,20,129,91,113,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
