However, everything changed on the day of the Black Sun, and following it, a magician appears before him. The Black Sun caused the Breakdown Phenomenon which destroyed the town where he lives. Because of this, his normal life was artificially reconstructed by a Grimoire that his childhood friend had left. Just what is the purpose of the magician coming to the town? What will he do with the Grimoire's keepsake?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage:\n\nAudio:\t\t\t\t\t : JAP\nText:\t\t\t\t\t : ENG\n\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nDuration                                 : 23mn 54s\nBit rate                                 : 1 016 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\nAudio:\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 23mn 54s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 262 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\nVideo Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\nSubtitle Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\n\nThanks in advance to all people who will seed the torrent for as long as they can. ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b1a1ffbd1727bc9a1f7b5d7ade0d285ddee7ade","amp;dn":"%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D+Trinity+Seven+-+05+%5B720p%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b1a1ffbd1727bc9a1f7b5d7ade0d285ddee7ade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,26,31,251,209,114,123,201,161,247,181,215,173,224,210,133,221,238,122,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
