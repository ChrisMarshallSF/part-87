Ant reminisces about old-school Long Island strip joints vs. the new places &amp; the &quot;rug act&quot;. Ant whips out his spot-on Cosby impression for some hilarious &quot;rapey Cosby&quot; lines. The guys discuss midgets, Rev. Al and Wesley Snipes tax problems as well as Boardwalk Empire. The Starr Sisters join the show at the table and discuss Pussy Juice Lube, scissoring, sex positions, 69'ing and the tops come off. They then relocate to the couch for some stripper action, then come back for some shots. We close with roofie discussions, boob job talk, shaved or not shaved?, Ant losing his virginity to Buzz, tattoos, Ebola, Foreign Policy and more. \n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2840ffd9306a681dc4cb9fd7010533bced2179","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-20+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2840ffd9306a681dc4cb9fd7010533bced2179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,40,64,255,217,48,106,104,29,196,203,159,215,1,5,51,188,237,33,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
