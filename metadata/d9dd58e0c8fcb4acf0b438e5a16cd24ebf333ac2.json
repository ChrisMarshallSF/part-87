Why the German edition is based on the English, rather than the\n   French, version's artwork, is unexplained. Be that as it may, the (IMO\n   regrettable) upshot is that all of the above alterations are present here.\n\n   There is what clearly seems to me to be a minor continuity mistake in the\n   captioning on page 54 (top row of panels), but as this, too, was present in\n   both the English and German versions, it stands to reason that it must also be\n   present in all of the original versions; therefore, I did not presume to\n   correct it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9dd58e0c8fcb4acf0b438e5a16cd24ebf333ac2","amp;dn":"Tintin+in+America+%281931%2F1945%29+%28HR-1920-Color%29+%28FM%2BNW%29-%28gesserit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9dd58e0c8fcb4acf0b438e5a16cd24ebf333ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,221,88,224,200,252,180,172,240,180,56,229,161,108,210,78,191,51,58,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
