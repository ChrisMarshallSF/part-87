Influencing Bands such as Death, Illdisposed or Necrophagist can be used to give you a little clue of the direction of SymbolicÃ‚Â´s sound. At live concerts, the bandÃ‚Â´s slogan is &quot;plugÃ‚Â´nÃ‚Â´play&quot;\n\nThey released their debut on CD in 2006 with their album ENIGMA, a free agent release which got positive reviews in many magazines. Having had interim line-up problems over the years before and after their debut release, a constant member structure emerged in 2009 and the second album SCARVEST (2011) was released via TWILIGHT-DISTRIBUTION.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the release of SCARVEST - which incidentally earned consistently positive reactions, which in turn gave the band an invite to play at the STRONG ATTITUDE TOUR throughout Europe opening for and touring with with Ektomorf.\n\nAt the moment SYMBOLIC are still busy songwriting and pre-recording for the upcoming album which will contain their known trademarks and new influences. The album, titled,  Omnidescent will be released on 31st October 2014\n\nLine-up:\nBastian LÃƒÂ¶ser - Vocals\nAndreas Schiegl - Guitars\nJosef Hiltmann - Guitars\nSebastian Kister - Bass\nTobias Schill - Drums\n\n\nDiscography:\nEnigma 2006\nScarvest   2011\nOmnidescent   2014\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01. 101\n02.
