However, I'd wager a bet that you won't have seen a slasher movie from Austria before, and you certainly will not see a slasher movie as inadvertently insane as this one.\n\nStefan Peczelt and Elmar Weihsmann, the writer/director team behind this crazy movie, are not exactly the Coen Brothers; but this latest release on UK imprint Brain Damage Films is competently enough put together, and does at least look to have been shot on film rather than DV (unlike most other indie efforts these days), more than likely on 16mm. However, despite its being made with an entirely Austrian cast, the strange (but commercially understandable) decision has been taken somewhere down the line to shoot the whole thing in English! Much unintentional hilarity results from this one fateful decision; every scene is shot through with a host of baffling mispronunciations, malapropisms and a weirdly stilted intonation from a cast who, whether they're playing a deranged killer or a buxom bikini babe, all have accents that make them sound exactly like a slightly confused Arnold Schwarzenegger; many of them seem to be speaking their lines phonetically, without too much idea of what they're actually saying. Not surprisingly, nearly all the performances in the film are eccentric to say the least, which results only in making this one of the funniest flicks I've seen in a good while. That may not have been the original intention, but one must take one's pleasures where one finds them when wading through the mire of low budget indie schlock.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 704x384, 23.976 fps, 1294 kbps, 01h23m56s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\n\nDVD Rip but not really sharp, English audio, no subtitles\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAcAIAagj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAcAIAagj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gacaKaaGj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gacaKaaGj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GACALaAGj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GACALaAGj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GACAmaAGJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GACAmaAGJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginally posted at RL, September 2012.
