The 19-and-a-half minute, six-part &quot;Variations for Trumpet&quot; is a major showcase for Ellis, &quot;Scratt and Fluggs&quot; is a brief bit of silliness, and the relatively straightforward &quot;K.C. Blues&quot; features altoist Frank Strozier, John Klemmer on tenor, and keyboardist Pete Robinson. However it is the 17-and-a-half minute &quot;Indian Lady&quot; (a live remake) that really finds the band going crazy.\n\nEllis, trombonist Glen Ferris, and keyboardist Robinson play humorous solos before tenors John Klemmer and Sam Falzone engage in a long and nutty tradeoff that is often quite hilarious. The many false endings at the end of this performance add to the general atmosphere. This is a classic release. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
