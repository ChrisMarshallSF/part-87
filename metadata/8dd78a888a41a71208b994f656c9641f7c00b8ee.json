I saw them on this tour several times, and they rocked.  The set list itself is a mix of soundboard and audience recordings, and as such the audience tracks (10-14) suffer from some distortion.  That said, the soundboard tracks (1-9) make this disc worth the money I paid for it back then.  I'm in the mood to up some of my long-ago purchased silver CD's... so here you go.  Artwork scans included.\n\nEnjoy, share, trade freely but do not sell!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd78a888a41a71208b994f656c9641f7c00b8ee","amp;dn":"1995-02-15%2C+MTV+Unplugged%2C+Brooklyn+Academy+of+Music%2C+Brooklyn%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd78a888a41a71208b994f656c9641f7c00b8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,215,138,136,138,65,167,18,8,185,148,246,86,201,100,31,124,0,184,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
