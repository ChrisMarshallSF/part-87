The pair admit there is an element of danger in their work.\n\nDaow said: 'I'm a little nervous sometimes - but I find the experience exciting and scary at the same time. Life is short so I try to enjoy the moment.'\n\nNicholaus revealed lightning is the most dangerous element to deal with and has halted their shoots in the past.\n\nHe added: 'I try usually to set up well before the storm gets to us.\n\n'Daow does well with the danger but we communicate and if either of us feels unsafe then we pack up and move on.\n\n'My two favourite subjects to photograph are storms and mountains. Mountains are epic in their scale but nothing compares to being next to a dramatic supercell.'\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2792094/man-photographs-wife-epic-tornadoes-hurricanes-lightning-storms.html#ixzz3I1WKPpQt\n\nMP4 videos:\n\n1.
