It's Albert Zugsmith and his cast of lovable regulars in a story of union corruption. Within the first two minutes, Oscar &quot;The Executioner&quot; tosses a guy into a cement mixer and the action doesn't let up from there!\n\nMickey Rooney plays a crooked union boss who will stop at nothing and do anything to anyone who gets in his way. Steve Cochran plays the man who can testify that he saw the labor boss in an incriminating conversation with a known criminal.\n\nMamie Van Doren plays a nice wife and homemaker with huge boobs. Mel TormÃƒÂ© plays a witness who confronts a strong arm union goon. Jay North (Dennis the Menace) plays little boy Timmy who is kidnapped on Halloween by two creepy crooks who lure him into their car with candy.\n\nSteve Cochran is abducted and taken to a house on the outskirts of town. Then his eyes are taped shut and he is beaten to a pulp because he refuses to promise not to testify. It just goes on and on! Look at this cast: Mickey Rooney, Steve Cochran, Mamie Van Doren, Mel TormÃƒÂ©, Jim Backus, Ray Anthony, Jackie Coogan, Charles Chaplin Jr., Vampira, Ray Danton, Norman Grabowski, Jay North.\n\nThe film earned $330,000 in the US and Canada and $350,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $253,000.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 712 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 91 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f67a3609f731ec2450226402582a0de0013a27f","amp;dn":"The+Big+Operator+%281959%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Mickey+Rooney%2C+Mamie+Van+Dore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f67a3609f731ec2450226402582a0de0013a27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,103,163,96,159,115,30,194,69,2,38,64,37,130,160,222,0,19,162,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
