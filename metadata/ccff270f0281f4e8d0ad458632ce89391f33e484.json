The owner claims it's a good luck charm. The statue also wore a medallion around it's neck. The careless pawn shop owner took off the medallion setting the Leprechaun free, along with his pot of gold that everyone wants and like before, he'll kill anyone who goes near it. Driving into town that night was a young man named Scott who was off to L.A. to go to school. Along the way he meets a sarcastic, but friendly, girl named Tammy. Scott tries gambling but loses everything, so he goes to the pawn shop to pawn his Rolex watch. At the shop, he finds the dead owner and one of Leprechaun's gold coins that grants a wish to its finder. Scott wishes for a winning streak, but what he does not know is that the casino is run by a crooked man who hates to lose. Also in the casino is an ignorant and dim magician Fazio and Loretta, a middle-aged gal. Before long, Leprechaun shows up to claim his coin, he bites Scott and in the process some of Leprechaun's green blood spills into Scott's wound, so before long Scott transforms into a tall Leprechaun and he needs some help! Only trouble is, the hospital doesn't accept his insurance company: Green Cross. The Leprechaun kills and mauls everyone in his path for his measly gold coin and Scott must choose whether to destroy the pot of gold as well as Leprechaun, or keep it and remain a Leprechaun himself.              \n\nACTORS: \nWarwick Davis, John Gatins, Lee Armstrong, John DeMita, Michael Callan, Caroline Williams, \n\nRELEASED: \n 27 June 1995 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113636/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113636/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 8217751578 bytes (7.65 GiB), duration: 01:33:16, avg.bitrate: 11748 kb/s\nAudio: dts, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 1920x1080, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=15271665174214138621.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=15271665174214138621.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=00204167423298211558.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=00204167423298211558.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=16155645774580852174.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=16155645774580852174.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : PHOBOS\n Movie Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccff270f0281f4e8d0ad458632ce89391f33e484","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+3+1995+1080p+BluRay+x264-PHOBOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccff270f0281f4e8d0ad458632ce89391f33e484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,255,39,15,2,129,244,232,208,173,69,134,50,206,137,57,31,51,228,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
