Earth has obtained the utopia of complete peace and no wants.\n\nFirst princess of the Misurugi Empire, Angelize. As with everyone else, she also had no wants or worries. She was celebrated by the people of the empire, and was supposed to wear the crown. However, she realizes the shocking truth that she is a Norma. &quot;Norma&quot;: An irregular existence that cannot use Mana, and are treated as heretics and as &quot;things&quot; rather than people. Having everything stolen from her, she isolates herself on a remote island.\n\nScreenshot:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage:\n\nAudio:\t\t\t\t\t : JAP\nText/Subs:\t\t\t\t : ENG/Spanish\n\nVideo:\n\nDuration                                 : 23mn 42s\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 23mn 42s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\nSubtitle Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs/Commie/PayuSubs\n\nAdvance THANKS! to all people that will seed this torrent for as long as they can. ^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d97f560cb1edca89d102bbcfb27de066fe944fc","amp;dn":"%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D+Cross+Ange+-+05+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d97f560cb1edca89d102bbcfb27de066fe944fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,151,245,96,203,30,220,168,157,16,43,188,251,39,222,6,111,233,68,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
