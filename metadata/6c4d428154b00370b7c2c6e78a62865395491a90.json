Once more I  have to inform you there's little information on this band, as with those before them.\n\nThe 'little info' scenario will not remain forever, because Be Under Arms are a very good band with a sound to match, it won't be long before they are better known within the walls of the rock fraternity. perfcci \n\nThe band formed at the beginning of 2013, in Moscow, Russia by vocalists Anna and Vladimir, The band recorded their first EP &quot;Way of the bullet&quot; , and then in September 2013 released the single &quot;Panem et Circenses&quot; and In 2014 they release their first full-length album &quot;Let shots will be your music&quot;.\n\nBe Under Arms style, combines nu-metal , modern, groove and elements of alternative and hard rock. The concept of the band represents a unique atmosphere of old western music combined with steampunk in a modern, urbanized, world.\n\nThey are a melodical unit, 'measured' but eqaully intertwined with hurricane rhythms and heavy riffs. Both male and female vocals complement each other and take us on a trip to fury.\n\nBand influences include Slipknot, Stone Sour, Five Finger Death Punch.\n\n... and that's everything to be found. Have a listen, they can be compared to Cripper, the mighty German Thrash band and for that I know you won't be disappointed with what you hear, this is a worthy entry to the annuls of rock and metal history.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nWay of The Bullet [EP] 2013\nPanem Et Circenses [Single] 2013\nLet Shots Will Be Your Music [LP] NOVEMBER 2014\n\n \n\nLine-Up:\nVladimir Ã‚Â«SzandorÃ‚Â» Nasonov Ã¢â‚¬â€ vocals\nAnna Ã‚Â«White queenÃ‚Â» Logachova Ã¢â‚¬â€ vocals\nDenis Ã‚Â«John DoeÃ‚Â» Vinitskiy Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums\nAlexandr Ã‚Â«Johnny DaysonÃ‚Â» Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar\nVictor Gostemilov Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar\nDmitry Kashirin Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Be Under Arms\nAlbum: Let Shots Will Be Your Music\nGenre: Power\nSubGenre:  Speed / Heavy\nCountry Of Origin: Moscow, Russia\nYear: 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: CBR 320kbps\nSize: 103.46 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
