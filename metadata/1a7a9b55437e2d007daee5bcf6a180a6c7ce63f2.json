The remaining parts include both piano performances and a few on the harpsichord (although I loath the harpsichord). Note that all files have been altered.\n\nI suppose my loathing of the harpsichord augments my estimation of &quot;J.S. Bach&quot; by several orders of magnitude. You know, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ like I would've just gone into &quot;plumbing&quot; or something; where at least there's *some* chance of feeling a sense of beauty and satisfaction as a result of your labors.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's why they invented the piano.\n\n-----------------\n\nAnyway, Here is the &quot;track&quot; list (some audio changes were made to the previous versions):\n--------------------------------\n01. Beethoven Piano Sonata Op 110 NÃ‚Âº3\n02. Beethoven 15 Variations and Fuge Op 35 1960\n03. J.S. Bach - Well Tempered Klavier Book II - No 14 F-Sharp Min\n04. J.S. Bach Partita NÃ‚Âº5 Allemande\n05. Fantasia - Jan Sweelinck (1562-1621)\n06. Beethoven, Bagatelle NÃ‚Âº3 Op 126\n07. J.S. Bach - Das Wohltemperierte Klavier II, Fuga 22\n08. Ludwig van Beethoven - Sonata Opus 31 NÃ‚Âº2\n09. Paul Hindemith - Piano Sonata NÃ‚Âº3 Fugue\n\nThe quality is variable both audio and video. Some great, some not so great. \n\nAlso, there were several works I discarded from this set; Two (or 3?) operas, one of them being a comedy in English and another was in German. I thought the first was simply too corny. But more to the point: if I had it in my music library I would *never* include it in any playlist!\n\nAs for the other opera(s), simply *being* an opera already has a strike against it for me with my *personal* preferences. Normally I wouldn't listen to an opera, I just don't like them. Normally Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nAs with everything of course, there are one or two exceptions. One of the exceptions is something called &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; which has about a thousand versions. But the one I like is by &quot;Pergolesi&quot; (it is the opening music for the film &quot;Jesus de MontrÃƒÂ©al&quot;). Another is Mozart's unfinished Requiem.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of others, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ actually yes I can think of another: &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet. I'd definitely listen to Carmen if I had any decent version of it.\n\nWell, anyway. Enjoy!\n\n- user101966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7a9b55437e2d007daee5bcf6a180a6c7ce63f2","amp;dn":"Glenn.Gould.Collection.Vol.I.AVC.AC3.720p.Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7a9b55437e2d007daee5bcf6a180a6c7ce63f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,122,155,85,67,126,45,0,125,174,229,188,246,161,128,166,199,206,99,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
