The basic musical style has been defined by the band as Modern Thrash Metal and until recently the band advertised for a regular Drummer on-line\nBand influences range from Metallica, Machine Head, Trivium, Devildriver. Where many bands attempt to recreate that of their heroes, Sacramental have created their own sound\nFor those of you with a love of Thrash Metal you should check out Sacramental, I can tell you without a doubt, you will definately dig the sound of this band.\nWe all know Europe hails some of the latest, greatest metal bands from all the subgenresthat exist within the metal circle. Listening to these guys on this morning (for the first time) with it's orchestral opening that then leads to fast dissorted guitar rhythms and heavy beats and timeless grooves, gave me the feeling the future of metal is in great shape and in the hands of these guys, a new generation of metal arises.\nWe will be hearing a lot from, Sacramental, in years to come. These guys will definately turn heads amongst die hard metalheads.\n\n\nDiscography:\nSibylla    2014 (Debut release)\n\n\nLine-Up:\nAlexander Bernatus (Vocals, Guitar)\nYuriy Paura (Bass - Guitar, Back - Vocals)\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Sacramental\nAlbum: Sibylla\nGenre: Thrash Metal\nSubGenre:  Groove Metal\nCountry Of Origin: Latvia\nYear: August 8th, 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320Kbs\nPlaying Time:\nSize: 98.44 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
