His earliest work on the subject, If I Die in a Combat Zone, was an intensely personal memoir of his own tour of duty; his books since then have featured many of the same elements of fear, boredom, and moral ambiguity but in a fictional setting. In 1994 O'Brien wrote In the Lake of the Woods, a novel that, while imbued with the troubled spirit of Vietnam, takes place entirely after the war and in the United States. The main character, John Wade, is a man in crisis: after spending years building a successful political career, he finds his future derailed during a bid for the U.S. Senate by revelations about his past as a soldier in Vietnam. The election lost by a landslide, John and his wife, Kathy, retreat to a small cabin on the shores of a Minnesota lake--from which Kathy mysteriously disappears.\nWas she murdered? Did she run away? Instead of answering these questions, O'Brien raises even more as he slowly reveals past lives and long-hidden secrets. Included in this third-person narrative are &quot;interviews&quot; with the couple's friends and family as well as footnoted excerpts from a mix of fictionalized newspaper reports on the case and real reports pertaining to historical events--a mÃƒÂ©lange that lends the novel an eerie sense of verisimilitude. If Kathy's disappearance is at the heart of this work, then John's involvement in a My Lai-type massacre in Vietnam is its core, and O'Brien uses it to demonstrate how wars don't necessarily end when governments say they do. In the Lake of the Woods may not be true, but it feels true--and for Tim O'Brien, that's true enough. --Alix Wilber\n\nFile Size: ~1.37 MB\nPrint Length: 322 pages\nFile Format: PDF\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 061870986X\nISBN-13: 978-0618709861","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad39ec5de764352b068f9f86bdc4e72524c0ce6","amp;dn":"In+the+Lake+of+the+Woods+-+Tim+O%27Brien+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad39ec5de764352b068f9f86bdc4e72524c0ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,211,158,197,222,118,67,82,176,104,249,248,107,220,78,114,82,76,12,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
