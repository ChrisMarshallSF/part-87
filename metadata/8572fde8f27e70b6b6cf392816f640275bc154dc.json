It was released on April 19, 2004 by Spinefarm Records in Finland and by Century Media outside.\n\nNattfÃƒÂ¶dd marks a change in the musical direction of Finntroll, as they drift into a slightly slower, less frenzied sound that is reminiscent of some songs from their first album, Midnattens widunder.
