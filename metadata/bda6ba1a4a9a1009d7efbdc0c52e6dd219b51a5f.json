He shows us video of the NASA rocket that exploded, introduces us to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smuggs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we go through a list of the most photographed places in the world, and then he takes a few calls. We hear about some ridiculous internet scam stories, one about a dirty janitor, and discuss drone use and see a video of a few in action. Ant talks about Jose ConsecoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gun mishap, Charles Barkley, Pope FrancisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Big Bang theory, Keith Olbermann, and the website Gawker. Before the show ends, we see part of a Sarah Palin interview and look at vintage advertisements.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed! \n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda6ba1a4a9a1009d7efbdc0c52e6dd219b51a5f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-29+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda6ba1a4a9a1009d7efbdc0c52e6dd219b51a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,166,186,26,74,154,16,9,215,239,189,192,197,46,109,210,25,181,26,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
