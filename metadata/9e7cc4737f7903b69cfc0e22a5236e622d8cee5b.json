The film depicts an account of Allied Combined Operations Headquarters commandos executing a daring raid on the German-occupied French coast during the Second World War. The film is based on the commando raid on the French port of St. Nazaire and is reminiscent of the film The Gift Horse. In the United States it was released as a double feature with Danger Route. In the UK it was released as a double bill with The Beatles' animated film Yellow Submarine.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Lloyd Bridges as Major James Wilson\n    Andrew Keir as Captain Owen Franklin\n    Sue Lloyd as Sue Wilson\n    Mark Eden as Lieutenant Commander Donald Kimberly\n    Maurice Denham as Rear Admiral Sir Frederick Grafton\n    Glyn Owen as Forrester\n    Howard Pays as Lieutenant Graham\n    Walter Gotell as Col. von Horst\n    John Welsh as Admiral of the Fleet Lord William Cansley\n    George Mikell as Capt.

Champion\nWritten by Herman Hoffman\nMusic by Gerard Schurmann\nRunning time 89 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Attack on the Iron Coast (1968)\nCanadian Commando Major Jamie Wilson plans an audacious Combined Operations raid on the Axis held French port of Le Clare; if destroyed the Germans would be stripped of their only dry dock capable of servicing their large battleships. Wilson's plan code named Operation Mad Dog, is to ram a destroyer packed with tons of explosives into the outer gate of the dock, while his commandos cause havoc to the docks facilities and garrison and then detonate the explosive laden destroyer. Opposed to Wilson is Royal Navy Captain Owen Franklin, whose own son was killed on Wilson's disastrous last Dieppe Raid type raid on the French coast at Le PlagÃƒÂ©.\n\nUnder pressure from Winston Churchill, Wilson's plan is given the go-ahead even though the naval craft requested for the mission are reduced to a minesweeper replacing the destroyer, no escort craft and only four motor launches. The mission's naval commander Lt. Commander Don Kimberly is blinded in a training accident while trying to save an injured commando, who dies from his injuries. With no other option Franklin is ordered to replace Kimberly, and thus put him in direct conflict with Wilson on the journey to France. As they cross the English Channel Wilson finds himself at odds with Franklin when the supporting air raid seems to be cancelled, but to Wilson's surprise Franklin ignores the order to return and changes his view of both Wilson and the mission.\n\nWith a united group heading into the port, the Germans discover the approaching minesweeper and its commando carrying escort of motor launches. After briefly stalling the Germans the convoy is bombarded by the coastal batteries which line the port entrance, but fail to stop the minesweeper from ramming the dock gate. As the commandos storm ashore leaving Wilson on the minesweeper's bridge it is hit once again, this time though Wilson is mortally wounded. In the port's facilities a running battle rages between the Germans and the commandos, leading to Franklin being captured and taken to the German HQ.\n\nBrought in front of the garrison commander, Colonel von Horst, Franklin is mocked for what the Germans see as a fruitless aim. Meanwhile a German party led by von Horst's subordinate Captain Erich Strasser boards the minesweeper and heads for the smashed bridge where Wilson barely alive, notices that the detonating circuit is broken. As Strasser enters the bridge, Wilson, with his last ounce of strength places the two wires together, completing the circuit the explosives detonate destroying the dock gate. In the German HQ, Franklin merely grins at the horror on the Germans' faces as the explosion rocks the building before commandos storm the HQ and liberate him, killing von Horst and his men. Franklin and the commandos then depart in the waiting motor launches with their mission completed.\n\n===================================================================================\nBeach Red (1967) Xvid 1cd - War Drama - Cornel Wilde, Jean Wallace [DDR]\n\nBeach Red is a 1967 World War II film starring Cornel Wilde (who also directed) and Rip Torn. The film depicts a landing by the U.S. Marine Corps on an unnamed Japanese held Pacific island, however is thought to be Red Beach, Palo, Leyte in the Philippines. A reference to the recent Bougainville Campaign early in the film presumably dates the action to November 1943 or later. During World War II Allied amphibious operations, designated invasion beaches were code named by colour; such as Beach Red, Beach White, Beach Blue etc.\n\nThe film is based on a lengthy piece of prose, not quite a novel written by Peter Bowman based on his experiences with the US Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific Islands campaigns.\n\nCAST:-\nCornel Wilde\nRip Torn \nBurr DeBenning\nPatrick Wolfe \nJean Wallace\nJaime SÃƒÂ¡nchez \nDale Ishimoto\nGenki Koyama\n\nDirected by Cornel Wilde\nWritten by Peter Bowman\nRunning time 105 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Beach Red (1967)\nThe opening sequence of an opposed beach landing bears a stylistic resemblance to Saving Private Ryan, even though there is more than thirty years between the productions. In one scene during the landing a Marine is shown with his arm blown off similar to Tom Lea's painting The Price.\n\nAs Americans are shown consolidating their gains, flashbacks illustrate the lives of American and Japanese combatants. Shifting first person voice over in a stream of consciousness style is also used to portray thoughts of numerous characters. Like Wilde's previous production of The Naked Prey the film does not use subtitles for characters speaking Japanese.\n\nThe film contains large sections of voice over sections, often juxtaposed with still photographs of wives etc. (who inexplicably are dressed in 1967 attire rather than WW2). It contains a huge amount of crying by the troops, and an abnormal sympathy for the enemy. In one scene an injured marine is lying close to an injured Japanese soldier in a scene paralleling the famous scene in All Quiet On The Western Front just after they bond, other marines appear and kill the Japanese soldier causing distress to the first marine.\n\nDirector, producer, and co-writer Wilde plays a Marine Captain the company commander, Rip Torn plays his believable company gunnery sergeant who says the film's tagline &quot;That's what we're here for. To kill. The rest is all crap!&quot; .\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 3236 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 301 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7cc4737f7903b69cfc0e22a5236e622d8cee5b","amp;dn":"War+Films+-+Attack+%281956%29+-+Attack+on+the+Iron+Coast+%281968%29+-+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7cc4737f7903b69cfc0e22a5236e622d8cee5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,124,196,115,127,121,3,182,156,252,14,34,165,35,110,98,45,140,238,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
