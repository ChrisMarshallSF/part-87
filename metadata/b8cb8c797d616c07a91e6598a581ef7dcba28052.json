Dean Wareham's live guitar playing by this time had become the stuff of legend, and nearly twenty five years later, while touring the world with the Dean &amp; Britta band, revisiting the music of Galaxie 500, he said that while it all sounds easy and rather laid back, that he'd forgotten how difficult it was to play these songs.\n\nI smile with a rye sense of satisfaction while listening to this stellar release, where despite the band's infighting, they manage to show the world how it's done ... and me, I was bobbing my head and dancing in place the whole time. Dean's voice does sound young, and weren't we all, as we listened to some of the best lamenting and drug fueled neo-psychedelic music that will ever slip through your ears. The outcome is dynamic, professionally monitored and recorded off site, managing to capture a brief moment in a short history, that will live for all time.
