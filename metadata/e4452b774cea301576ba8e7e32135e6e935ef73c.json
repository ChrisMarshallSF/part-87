Some are less obscure than others such as Budgie and Groundhogs who had some success. These have been individual torrents by me before but now they are collected here all in one place. Some bands have more songs here than others especially if you compare the beginning of the collection to the end but that was just my way of making it all come full circle.  \n\nFeel free to share with anyone anytime anywhere.\nSeed if possible.
