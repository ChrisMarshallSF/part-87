Ant waxes about his old CB radio, goes through a few Tinder pics, talks about hookers, we see a note from Bobo's doctor, and Ant lifts the show ban on Bobo even though KtC doesn't agree. We then go through a list of teachers who've had sex with students, Ant takes a couple of calls, and we hear police audio from Bristol Palin. Against his better judgment, @BrokenCurse gets unblocked by Anthony thanks to Ticket University, we watch a video of a tittie twerker, one from religious extremists, and find out that the official TACS Paltalk chatroom is up. Ant shows us a video from drunken prankster Australians, tells us about some pranks they used to play on Joe Currie, we watch a clip of a crying criminal, wish Keith Robinson a happy birthday, see some foreign chicks dancing, and he finishes up with an educational YouTube video","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa57b690bb675701b066081303e501ae68f1df82","amp;dn":"2014-10-23.The+Anthony+Cumia+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa57b690bb675701b066081303e501ae68f1df82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,87,182,144,187,103,87,1,176,102,8,19,3,229,1,174,104,241,223,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
