For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready. Marriage Supper of the Lamb - Revelation 19 v.9 Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.&quot; (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints). Then the angel said to me, &quot;write: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!'&quot; And he added, &quot;These are the true words of God&quot;.\n\nAt this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, &quot;Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&quot; (Rev. 19 v.7-10)\n\nThe marriage supper of the Lamb is a subject greatly misunderstood, not because of erroneous teaching, but because it is almost neglected in preaching today. The main source of information concerning this coming event is found in Rev. 19 v.7-10, which falls into two main divisions: (1) the marriage of the Lamb, and (2) the marriage supper of the Lamb.\n\nThe marriage supper of the Lamb is after the Rapture and following the judgment seat of Christ, where the members of the church will be rewarded for their faithful service (See 1 Cor. 3 v.10-15; 2 Cor 5 v.10). A marriage will take place. The church, &quot;the bride of Christ&quot; and our Lord Jesus Christ will be officially married in heaven. While the earth is suffering through the last throes of the Tribulation, the church will enjoy a heavenly wedding. And then a feast!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dfe3f0af375c1fa1bebb8b9d7ab420d53f3f261","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+69+-+The+Marriage+of+Jesus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dfe3f0af375c1fa1bebb8b9d7ab420d53f3f261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,254,63,10,243,117,193,250,27,235,184,185,215,171,66,13,83,243,242,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
