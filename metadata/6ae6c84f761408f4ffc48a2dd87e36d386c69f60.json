Typically the textbooks all have the same lessons, just in a different order. So you can use the list below to figure out which lessons to download.\n\nAdmittedly some of the earlier lessons are pretty crappy but the later ones were normally enjoyed by my students. Sorry if any videos are missing, I'm sure you could find then on Youtube pretty easily.\n\nPlease be patient with the seeding because my computer is not always on. It would probably be better for you to just download the lessons that you need as opposed to everything.\n\nHopefully this can help you with your lesson planning :)\n\n\nGrade 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ YBM Si-Sa\n1:  Hello!\n2:  What's This?\n3:  Are You Happy?\n4:  Happy Birthday!\n5:  What Color Is It?\n6:  I Have Two Tomatoes\n7:  Jump!
