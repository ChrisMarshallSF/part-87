He discusses the grand juryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to not indict Daniel Pantaleo, breaks down the Eric Garner video, takes some calls to hear what the listeners think about the case, and talks about how effective protests are. We watch a Ã¢â‚¬Å“non-complyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ police video, hear a story about a twelve-year-old getting shot that is oddly getting zero attention, debate people dismissing the day-to-day happenings before events, and the callers chime in once again. Ant ends the show by playing us a video from a fat pig who is ironically offended by a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weight loss sign, one from Korea teaching people English, one from Japan talking about who the fuck knows what, and another one from Japan that helps give gals insta-cleavage.\n\nPART A (show split in two)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf61bad2c83b1a00db89dad4746ccfa7e4a4df1","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+-+2014-12-03+PART+A.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf61bad2c83b1a00db89dad4746ccfa7e4a4df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,246,27,173,44,131,177,160,13,184,157,173,71,70,204,250,126,74,77,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
