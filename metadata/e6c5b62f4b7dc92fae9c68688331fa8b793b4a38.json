Second i started seriouly modding skyrim for about 3 months.\nI've been searching for some &quot;ALL in ONE Skyrim Modded pack&quot; for a long time. \nThere aren't many out there. Like 4 or 5.\nI'm one of those lazy guys that trying to setup eveything perfectly is too much trouble.\nIf youre one of those then try this!!\n\nOf course i've been there. Done my share of compilations packs. Ussualy all unstable.\n\nTried S.T.E.P. which was stable but too boring. Tryed Skyrim beautification project with gameplay mods of my own and again very unstable.\n\nI've instaled like 20 times Mod organizer or nexus mod manager to installed a fresh copy of skyrim to get the best results of my choice and they didn't turn out how i liked it.\n\nI started to get an addiction of uninstalling and reinstalling mods  instead of playing against all bugs and crashes.\n\nFinaly i found a pack that was more stable then the others.\n\nIt was called &quot;ReDone: Skyrim Ultimate Modded - Legendary Epic Edition&quot; made by &quot;ExtremeModder&quot; that you can find out there on the torrent sites.\nGreat thanks to ExtremeModder for bringing a more stable skyrim experience. He spent 2 months of his life to bring us that AIO.\n\nIf you want the original pack go and download it from him.\n\nThen i wanted to chage a few things in his pack so here is some of the changes i made.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIm lazy enough to not put here every mod that i changed but gona try and put the most important ones.\n\nI love T3nd0s Skyrim Redone.(so many perks...) Switched with Ace Combat. if you like Ace go and download ExtremeModder pack.\n\nNot tested but inside.\nAdded Falskaar.\nAdded Wyrmtooth.\nAdded Moonpath.\nAdded Undeath.\nAdded The Wheels of Lull (recent) Go to nexusmods.com and endorse it.\nAdded the awesome Windstad Mine.\n\nAdded several companions: Inigo, Valfar, Hoth(my favourite), Sofia and other followers.\nYou can have 100 with Extensible Follower Framework(much better then Amazing Follower Tweaks)\n\nAdded Apocalypse Spells but havent tried anything related to magic.\n\nAdded 2 new races. the Lykaios(wolfs) and Tempress(female) race.\n\nAdded a mod that allows you to become a vampire and werewolf on the same char.\n\nSome changes to textures and ENB to be able to play with my GTX660ti since original pack is for GTX770. i get 25 to 60fps.\n\nAlot more mods.\nI'm so lazy to put everything out there so i'm going to stop.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow here is a few thing you need to know about installing this.\n\nMy rig:\nI5-2500k (OC to 4.0)\n16GB ram (my game reaches 8-9GB when playing)\nGTX 660 Ti 2GB\nOCZ vertex 3 SSD (better to use SSD for loading times.)\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64bit.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. there's no crack, no TESV.exe or steam_api.dll or SkyrimLauncher.exe\nYou want them? Go buy the game on steam or download the crack somewhere else to get them.\nI don't care.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n2. There are 2 folders you need to copy them to your Windows.\n\nThe Install folder.\nDunno if it has to be the same but mine is \n\nC:SteamLibrarySteamAppscommon\n\nPlace all folders inside (Skyrim, Skyrim Mods)\n\nOfc have installed Steam Skyrim in that folder.\nJust overwrite all the files. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;YOURUSERNAME&quot; is your Windows user name folder.\n\n3. Place 3 files from Load Order folder\n\nC:UsersYOURUSERNAMEAppDataLocalSkyrimloadorder.txt\nC:UsersYOURUSERNAMEAppDataLocalSkyrimPlugins.tes5viewsettings\nC:UsersYOURUSERNAMEAppDataLocalSkyrimplugins.txt\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;YOURUSERNAME&quot; is your Windows user name folder.\n\n4. Place all save files\n\nC:UsersYOURUSERNAMEDocumentsmy gamesSkyrim\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. Install Nexus mod manager &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSkyrim 3 Day DeadBody Timer.esp(cleans dead corpses after a time) and RichMerchants.esp(10000 gold each merchant) can't be checked cause they are already in Bashed patch.esp\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you need any more help with instalation go get \n\nExtremeModder\n\nReDone: Skyrim Ultimate Modded - Legendary Epic Edition\nFrom him.\n\nAgain i'm not here to teach you how to setup your first install of modded skyrim.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Now this is special. EXTREMELY ADVISED!!!!!!\nI've been testing it around and ive done one time 5 hours play time without a single crash.\nIt's not 100% full proof but i noticed it helped alot.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CleanMem&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n\nFor details how to set it up got to this page.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32363/?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32363/?&lt;/a&gt;\nRead this guide if you want. Endorse him.\n\nCheck his Section 5: Memory Management and watch the video to see how to install it properly. \n(When asked, his is on 2min, i've set mine to 15min)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you crash issue is &quot;quick saving&quot; do this:\n\n1. Load an older save (as long as it doesn't have CTD on save glitch, then load it)\n2. Create a NEW save (through pause menu)\n3. Type in console command player.kill\n--- during the death animation --- 4. Load your latest save (the one that had CTD glitch)\n5. Type in console command player.kill\n--- let the game autoloads (it will load your save from #4 above ---\n6. Try saving (I usually just use quicksave)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMess with Mod Configuration Menu at your leisure. (personaly i turn on The dance of death player kill immunity)\nAlso you can turn off Equipping Overhauls in MCM. It's just there cause i used to get some glitches not being there at all. If you like it, use it.\n\n\n\nThats it for installing.\nThings i think you dont have to but can do.\nIf you want to open Nexus Mod Manager go ahead.\nLOOT is inside skyrim folder, the 0.6.0 and the 0.7.0 alpha 4. both are working.\nTES5edit 3.0.33 also there with merge patch 1.7.\nWryebash use the one inside the &quot;mopy folder&quot;.\nReproccer(needed for T3nd0s mod) is &quot;SkyrimDataSkyProc PatchersT3nd0_ReProccerReProccer.jar&quot;\nDont forget to have Java installed.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think that's it.\n\nHave a good time.\n\nAnd make more All In One with your tastes and share them.\n\nhere's some pics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/a/KzPcd#0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/a/KzPcd#0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c5b62f4b7dc92fae9c68688331fa8b793b4a38","amp;dn":"ReDone+Skyrim+Ultimate+Modded-LAZyGUY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c5b62f4b7dc92fae9c68688331fa8b793b4a38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,197,182,47,75,125,201,47,174,156,104,104,131,49,250,139,121,59,74,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
