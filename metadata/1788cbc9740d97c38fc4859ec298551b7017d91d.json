A working model and newly single, Courtney fit the casting call: She was young, beautiful, and a natural in front of the cameras. As the season unfolded and sparks began to fly, it became clear: She was not there to make friends. Courtney quickly became one of the biggest villains in Bachelor franchise history. She unapologetically pursued her man, steamrolled her competition, and broke the rules.
