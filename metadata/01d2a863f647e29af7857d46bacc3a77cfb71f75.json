But this is all about to change. One sunny afternoon he experiences a frightening vision of an alien world, causing him to doubt his common perception and worldview. As he prays with all his heart to understand what happened, he enters into a meditational state, sliding deeper and deeper into the realms of his thoughts and feelings. There, he encounters something even more bizarre than his first vision: a voice that entangles him into an odd conversation. And so begins an breathtaking spiritual journey as the voice escorts George to meet his true self face-to-face and teaches him the secret riches of Christianity. Often witty and with many inspiring anecdotes, the voice slowly dilutes GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s common sense and opens his mind to receive Jesus ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long lost memorandum: the mystery of God Child and peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inevitable joyful destiny","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d2a863f647e29af7857d46bacc3a77cfb71f75","amp;dn":"God+Child+Part+I+Grand+Awakening.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d2a863f647e29af7857d46bacc3a77cfb71f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,210,168,99,246,71,226,154,247,133,125,70,186,204,58,119,207,183,31,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
