We also hear what Jesse Ventura has to say about Ebola, learn about a Brooklyn teacher facing 36 counts of kidnapping and criminal sex against minors, a teacher from Louisiana arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a student, and then the glorious callers chime in. Ant tells us about a woman suing a sperm bank for being inseminated by a black donor, he pitches us a charitable idea called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Feels For Meals,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we are introduced to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Japanese Bobo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ watch a Japanese game show, and we see Ã¢â‚¬Å“tough girlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and never want to see it again. The show ends with us enduring a call from Lady Trucker and Lady Di, talking about rapey porn, and chatting about message boards.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce023cee28a7a53e151ed3e548100eedb844d42","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-01+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce023cee28a7a53e151ed3e548100eedb844d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,224,35,206,226,138,122,83,225,81,237,62,84,129,0,238,219,132,77,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
