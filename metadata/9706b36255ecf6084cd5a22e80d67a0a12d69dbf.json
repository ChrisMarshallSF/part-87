Now he sets his sights on the rest of humanity. With the Legacy Virus cured through the sacrifice of Colossus' life, Magneto becomes obsessed with the death of the X-Men and what he felt was Xavier's inability to keep Colossus from dying for the sake of mutantkind.\n\nThe storyline follows on directly from the Dream's End storyline and was part of a four-month period in 2001 on the two core X-Men books, where former X-Men writer Scott Lobdell was brought back to wrap up the dangling plotline of the Legacy Virus and produce filler material while Marvel planned the highly anticipated arrival of Grant Morrison and Joe Casey as writers for the main two X-Men books. As a result, this can be seen as a &quot;finale&quot; to the X-men storylines from the 90s era. It would be several years before Uncanny X-Men and X-Men crossed over with each other since this story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9706b36255ecf6084cd5a22e80d67a0a12d69dbf","amp;dn":"Eve+of+Destruction+%26ndash%3B+2001+X-Men+Crossover+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9706b36255ecf6084cd5a22e80d67a0a12d69dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,6,179,98,85,236,246,8,76,213,162,46,128,214,122,10,18,214,157,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
