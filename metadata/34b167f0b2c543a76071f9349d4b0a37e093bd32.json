He was \nportrayed to the German people as a great man, one who was in control of his \nown destiny and that of his country, and who was infallible - all but a \nsuper-human. Unsurprisingly, this was far from the truth. However, the facts, \nwhich this documentary gleans from his physician's diaries, are more remarkable \nthan any fiction. It transpires that the leader was in fact a hypochondriac and \na nervous wreck, who became increasingly dependent on a cocktail of drugs \nincluding powerful stimulants and depressants - uppers and downers - as well as \nall manner of pseudo-medicinal ? cures' for real and imagined illnesses\n\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34b167f0b2c543a76071f9349d4b0a37e093bd32","amp;dn":"Secret.History.Hitlers.Hidden.Drug.Habit.720p.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34b167f0b2c543a76071f9349d4b0a37e093bd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,177,103,240,178,197,67,167,96,113,249,52,157,75,10,55,224,147,189,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
