An exploration of the challenges and possible solutions to improve yields of the main crops, such as cereals, roots, tubers, and grasses, Omics Technologies and Crop Improvement reviews data on food sciences and omics. The book covers modern omic technologies such as nutrigenomics and metagenomics. It provides a detailed examination of how omics can help crop science and horticulture and introduces the benefits of using these technologies to increase crop yields and other features such as resistance and nutritional values.\n\nThe book highlights crop improvements such as increased yield, drought resistance, disease resistance, and value-added performance through a non-transgenic format. It explores how the different omics technologies, especially the most recent ones (proteomics, metabolomics, nutrigenomics, ionomics, and metagenomics) would be used to improve the quantitative and qualitative features of crop plants. Topics covered include:\n\nAdvances in omics for improved fresh crops\nTranscriptome analyses on the drought response using drought tolerant near isogenic lines\nMetabolite profiling that reveals different effects of nitrogen amendments on vegetables\nOmics technology application to forage crops improvement\nSecondary metabolites and plant tissue culture\nRNAi technology and crop improvement\nGene expression analysis methods with NGS data\nWeb database resources and crops improvement\nGene Expression Networks (GEN) in crops\nSpecific crop improvement (papaya, wheat, coffee, potato, and more)\nWith contributions from pioneering researchers from twelve countries, the book presents a broad view of how omics would help crop science and horticulture meet the challenges of a shrinking global food supply for a burgeoning global population","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065761465862590e802b3e78ec3a56746995c682","amp;dn":"Omics+Technologies+and+Crop+Improvement+MyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065761465862590e802b3e78ec3a56746995c682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,87,97,70,88,98,89,14,128,43,62,120,236,58,86,116,105,149,198,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
