When you look at every\nsingle piece of software that addresses these issues, many challenges are\nrevealed, and more often than not, they go beyond the scope of traditional\ndevelopment teams. Site Reliability Engineering (or Production Engineering\ndepending on the organization) has grown to address just these issues within\nlarge-scale systems.\n\nOur goal for SREcon is to share information about the details and principles\nthat drive us towards engineering excellence for the products, systems, and\narchitectures that we maintain.\n\nSRE professionals are invited to to join us and exchange information about the\nstrategies you used to deal with a certain type of challenge; an awesome bug\nhunting experience you had where the complexity and scale of the work\nenvironment made the issue not only large, but extremely interesting and worth\nsharing; and the types of issues you face working on such a large scale. Lastly,\nwe'll also discuss ideas or concepts that are always in the back of your mind\nthat help make the job easier.\n\nSREcon Organizers\n-----------------\n\nProgram Chairs:\n\n  - Sabrina Farmer, Senior Site Reliability ManagerÃ¢â‚¬â€Google Apps\n  - Andrew Fong, SRE Lead, Dropbox\n  - Fernanda Weiden, Manager of Production Engineering, Facebook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df5658a4e3c6ad057c7f0f1d07106b37a23a87da","amp;dn":"SRECON14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df5658a4e3c6ad057c7f0f1d07106b37a23a87da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,86,88,164,227,198,173,5,124,127,15,29,7,16,107,55,162,58,135,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
