With discussions exploring such practical applications as filters, fabrics, sensors, catalysts, scaffolding, drug delivery, and wound dressings, the book provides polymer scientists and engineers with a comprehensive, practical &quot;how-to&quot; reference. Moreover, the author offers an expert assessment of polymer nanofibers' near-term potential for commercialization. Among the highlights of coverage is the book's presentation of the science and technology of electrospinning, including practical information on how to electrospin different polymer systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85aa0fc2a3578363cacb1afd94128956c1ef2034","amp;dn":"Science+and+Technology+of+Polymer+Nanofibers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85aa0fc2a3578363cacb1afd94128956c1ef2034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,170,15,194,163,87,131,99,202,203,26,253,148,18,137,86,193,239,32,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
