La Granada Divino has only been open for eight weeks.

Their head chef is not the man they thought he was. Their relationship with him is at an all-time low and the restaurant is losing 4000 euros a month, despite there being many hungry tourists on their doorstep.\n\nAbout the programme\nGordon Ramsay visits some of Europe's holiday hotspots, meeting Brits abroad struggling with restaurants in crisis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6313a610860c2ac2472e01ac9b7b27be5ddd22db","amp;dn":"ramsays.costa.del.nightmares.s01e03.720p.hdtv.x264-barge.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6313a610860c2ac2472e01ac9b7b27be5ddd22db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,19,166,16,134,12,42,194,71,46,1,172,155,123,39,190,93,221,34,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
