Enjoy.\nIt is copywrited by:     Amanita Design. \n    \n   (I remember Amanita Muscaris, a fun, psychedelic/entheogenic mushroom which was good when you run out of Psylocybe Cubensis, and especially P. Cyanescens.) \n\nBy the way, do you know why the OLD, Gaelic-speaking Irish folks believe in the Leprechauns (little tiny people?) It's because they are all stoned on mushrooms that grow wild \n\n\nAnd don't forget to seeeeed!\nThanx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbef1a86f1af1a41808478db08685667e2c23466","amp;dn":"Install_Samorost2.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbef1a86f1af1a41808478db08685667e2c23466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,239,26,134,241,175,26,65,128,132,120,219,8,104,86,103,226,194,52,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
