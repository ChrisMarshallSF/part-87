All the music on this EP is entirely stand-alone, furiously creative and catchy in the most subtle ways.\n\nThis mini-album should be more than enough to get an idea of what Clubwerks is about.\n\nreleased 08 September 2014\n\nClubwerks art direction by Mihai Dragomir \n\ntags: bass, clubwerks, electronic, grime, house, jaona, jungle, techno, Bucharest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf483aac2425ebf8202a442869ce7f126d4d901","amp;dn":"Jaona+-+Midnight+Drummer+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf483aac2425ebf8202a442869ce7f126d4d901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,244,131,170,194,66,94,191,130,2,164,66,134,156,231,241,38,212,217,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
