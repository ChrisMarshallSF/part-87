Tired of the shitty looking cars and shitty sounding engines? Well I have the solution for you: the 1994 season!\n\nTake a step back in time to when V8s, V10s and V12s ruled the world. A controversial and tragic season, many said the right man won the title but in the wrong circumstances.\n\nThis torrent includes reviews of the 1994 races from the SPEED channel. Each one is around 45 minutes. The only race missing is France, so I've included a Eurosport version of the full French GP. Also included is a bonus 1994 review from Eurosport.\n\nEnjoy, and seed ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e70f4750629f4298190d72ed9bf88d5d9af18fa","amp;dn":"Formula+1+1994+Race+Reviews","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e70f4750629f4298190d72ed9bf88d5d9af18fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,112,244,117,6,41,244,41,129,144,215,46,217,191,136,213,217,175,24,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
