At issue in the film and the surrounding commentary are ArendtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (allegedly misleading) characterizations of the subject of her 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusalem, as well as her ambivalentÃ¢â‚¬â€some have said callous, even Ã¢â‚¬Å“victim-blamingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€treatment of other Jews. None of these controversies are new, however. As Arendt scholar Roger Berkowitz notes in a recent New York Times editorial, at the time of her bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s publication, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nearly every major literary and philosophical figure in New York chose sides in what the writer Irving Howe called a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcivil warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ among New York intellectuals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhile acknowledging ArendtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flaws, Berkowitz seeks to exonerate the best-known concept that emerged from her work on EichmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trial, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“banality of evil.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And while it can be comforting to have an interpreter explain, and defend, the work of a major, controversial, thinker, there is no intellectual substitute for engaging with the work itself. In the age of the media interviewÃ¢â‚¬â€radio, television, podcast and otherwiseÃ¢â‚¬â€one can usually see and hear an author explain her views in person. And so we have the interview above (in German with English subtitles), in which Arendt sits with television presenter and journalist Gunter Gaus for a German program called Zur Person (The Person), a Charlie Rose-like show that featured celebrities, important thinkers, and politicians (including an appearance by Henry Kissinger).\n\nA blogger at Jewish Philosophy Place writes that ArendtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interviewÃ¢â‚¬â€a transcript of which was later published in The Portable Hannah Arendt as Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Remains? Language RemainsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€is Ã¢â‚¬Å“slow and deliberative, not sharp and declarative, moving in circles, not straight lines.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The interview touches on a variety of topics, drawing on ideas expressed in ArendtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier works, The Origins of Totalitarianism and The Human Condition. She is somewhat cagey when it comes to the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eichmann Controversy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and she may have had personal as well as professional reasons for indirection. Her affair with her former professor, avowed and unrepentant Nazi Martin Heidegger, dogged her post-war career, and the aforementioned intellectual Ã¢â‚¬Å“civil warÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ probably increased her circumspection.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/misreading-hannah-arendts-eichmann-in-jerusalem/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/misreading-hannah-arendts-eichmann-in-jerusalem/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://harpers.org/blog/2009/12/_thinking-in-dark-times_-six-questions-for-roger-berkowitz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://harpers.org/blog/2009/12/_thinking-in-dark-times_-six-questions-for-roger-berkowitz/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/10/the_evil_of_banality.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2009/10/the_evil_of_banality.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21aa4cc161acb8a1c9338963cdc98e4acef234d7","amp;dn":"+Hannah+Arendt+-+interview+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21aa4cc161acb8a1c9338963cdc98e4acef234d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,170,76,193,97,172,184,161,201,51,137,99,205,201,142,74,206,242,52,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
