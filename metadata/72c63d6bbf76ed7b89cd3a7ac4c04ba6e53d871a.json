If it weren't for him we wouldn't have as good of a PS2 copy of this game unless you are fluent in Japanese then by all means enjoy anyway. I also  included a cheat file (.PNACH) for PCSX2 users. I also included a code converter and a .pnach file converter/creator in case you needed it. Check the webites and read me files for help in using them. I'd explain myself but this read me is too long already... \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote: The current .PNACH file included has been made and tested by me and they do work\nbut to avoid bugs and random T-stances follow these directions:\n\n         1.) Open F266B00B.pnach and the Removable Code File\n         2.) Copy and paste contents from the Removeable Code document to the .pnach\n\t 3.) MAKE SURE TO PUT ONE LINE OF SPACE BETWEEN THE LAST CODE IN THE .pnach FILE\n             AND WHAT YOU ARE PLACING IN THE FILE.\n         4.) Boot up the game in your emulator and play without cheats until you reach the first\n             save point AFTER you gain use of your abilities as Roxas (Dive to Heart)\n         5.) Save and Close the game; Save the .Pnach file and put it in the Cheats folder located in \n             C:Program Files (x86)PCSX2 1.2.1Cheats\n         6.) Open PCSX2 click on System ----&gt; Enable Cheats and then reboot and load your save\n         7.) Once its loaded Press R2 on your Controler and then hit start and open the ABILITES section\n             and disable all of the abilities except for Scan, Guard, and the Combo/ Air Combo Pluses.\n             (NOT DOING THIS AND THEN TRYING TO FIGHT OR USE THE GUARD BUTTON WILL RESULT IN ROXAS\n              T STANCING ESSENTIALLY FREEZING YOUR GAME)\n         8.) Resave your game and then close it again\n         9.) Reopen the .pnach and remove the Abilities and All Items code (You just saved all the items into your              inventory but it conflicts with the &quot;Have All Synthesis Materials&quot; code so it's easier to remove it)\n        10.) Reload your game and enjoy your English, Hacked, KH2FM+!!!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNote 2: As far as the Gummie Ship codes go, if you like doing the Missions and earning everything then REMOVE THE GUMMI CODES! The gummi codes will glitch the abilities list filling it only with Cannon upgrades and while the limits for both your Gummi and Teeni ships will look awesome I found that they are too good to be true going past the normal build limit will result in instant SELF DESTRUCT once the gummi mission starts. On the other hand if you don't really care to build your own ship and are ok with just using the default ships just to get between worlds then leave them in for completion sake ;D\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWebites: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://kh-vids.net/threads/kingdom-hearts-ii-final-mix-codes.117695/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://kh-vids.net/threads/kingdom-hearts-ii-final-mix-codes.117695/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-PCSX2CE-PCSX2-Cheat-Converter-Patch-File-Editor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-PCSX2CE-PCSX2-Cheat-Converter-Patch-File-Editor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.herrvillain.com/omniconvert/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.herrvillain.com/omniconvert/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c63d6bbf76ed7b89cd3a7ac4c04ba6e53d871a","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Hearts+2+Final+Mix%2B+%28English%29+with+cheats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c63d6bbf76ed7b89cd3a7ac4c04ba6e53d871a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,198,61,107,191,118,237,123,137,205,58,122,196,192,75,166,229,61,135,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
