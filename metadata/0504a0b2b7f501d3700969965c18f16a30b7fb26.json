The book was written by eight Shaolin masters shortly before their disappearance, and Hsu is suspected of killing them, or at least knowing what happened. In reality, Hsu is looking for the man responsible for the masters' disappearance, whom he will know by a certain mark.\n\nAfter several fights, and encounters with the leaders of many fighting clans (all of whom want the book and are willing to offer a variety of things for it), Hsu is betrayed, hurt, and eventually captured. He escapes with an unlikely ally in tow, while the rest of the clan leaders, having put aside their differences, search high and low for him. Eventually Hsu finds the man with the mark, the other clan leaders learn the fate of the Shaolin masters, and in an epic fight involving the Snake and Crane style, Hsu defeats the villain.\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nName:Snake and Crane Arts Of Shaolin (1978) [H264 - 1080p - Aac 5.1 - HardSub Ita].mkv\nFormat:Matroska\nVideo Codec:H.264\nFile Size:20,475,430,572 bytes (19526.892254 MiB)\nRuntime:01:40:34 (6033.951 s)\nBit rate:26564.714929 kbps\nWidth:1280 pixels\nHeight:1080 pixels\nFps:23.976 fps\nDisplay aspect ratio:16:9\n\nAudio language:Mandarin\nBit rate:16-bit\nChannels:6\nSampling rate:44100 Hz\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078251/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078251/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0504a0b2b7f501d3700969965c18f16a30b7fb26","amp;dn":"Snake+And+Crane+Arts+of+Shaolin+%281978%29+%5B1080p+H264+-+Chn+Aac+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0504a0b2b7f501d3700969965c18f16a30b7fb26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,4,160,178,183,245,1,211,112,9,105,150,92,24,241,106,48,183,251,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
