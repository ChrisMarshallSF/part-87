The show was modeled after syndicated newspaper columnist Thomas Braden, a real-life parent with eight children, who wrote a book with the same name.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe show centers on a Sacramento, California, family with eight children (from oldest to youngest: David, Mary, Joanie, Susan, Nancy, Elizabeth, Tommy, and Nicholas). The father, Tom Bradford, was a newspaper columnist for the fictional Sacramento Register. His wife Joan (Diana Hyland) took care of the children. Hyland was only in four episodes before falling ill; she was written out for the remainder of the first season and died 12 days after the first episode aired.\n\nThe second season began in the fall of 1977 with the revelation that Tom had become a widower. Tom fell in love with Sandra Sue Ã¢â‚¬Å“AbbyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Abbott, a schoolteacher who came to the house to tutor Tommy who had broken his leg in a football game. They were married in one of the seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ TV movie broadcasts on November 9, 1977. The role went to Buckley after being approved by network chief Brandon Tartikoff, who felt the character of the sympathetic teacher she had played in the 1976 film Carrie would also be great for the series.[1] In another TV movie event in September 1979, David and Susan were both married in a double wedding. As the series progressed, Abby got her Ph.D. in education and started a job counseling students at the local high school, oldest sister Mary became a doctor, while second-youngest son Tommy became a singer in a rock-and-roll band.\n\nCast and characters:\n\n\n    Dick Van Patten Ã¢â‚¬â€Tom Bradford\n    Diana HylandÃ¢â‚¬â€Joan Wells Bradford (season 1)\n    Betty BuckleyÃ¢â‚¬â€Sandra Sue &quot;Abby&quot; Abbott Bradford (seasons 2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5)\n    Grant GoodeveÃ¢â‚¬â€David Bradford (22 years old at start of series)\n    Lani O'GradyÃ¢â‚¬â€Mary Bradford (21)\n    Laurie WaltersÃ¢â‚¬â€Joanie Bradford (20)\n    Susan RichardsonÃ¢â‚¬â€Susan Bradford (19); later Susan (Bradford) Stockwell\n    Dianne KayÃ¢â‚¬â€Nancy Bradford (18)\n    Connie NeedhamÃ¢â‚¬â€Elizabeth Bradford (15) (originally credited as Connie Newton  before she married)\n    Willie AamesÃ¢â‚¬â€Tommy Bradford (14)\n    Adam RichÃ¢â‚¬â€Nicholas Bradford (8)\n\nNOTE - Keep It In Seed After Completion Cause It's A Very Big Torrent To Seed, Thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca43afcc95b2bf1b1111bbdb44c91ea5d1d2700","amp;dn":"Eight+Is+Enough+-+The+Complete+Series+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca43afcc95b2bf1b1111bbdb44c91ea5d1d2700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,164,58,252,201,91,43,241,177,17,27,189,180,76,145,234,93,29,39,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
