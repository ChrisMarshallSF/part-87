However, they only got so far as to re-record/remix some versions for the Best of 1990-2000 compilation and various single releases. A fully fleshed out re-release has yet to see the light of day.\n\nIn my continuing experiment to revisit and 'remix' U2 albums to bring them into a new light, I offer a new, alternate version of Pop that excises two tracks, substitutes alternate versions, includes songs that should have made the album, and present them in a more sonically cohesive running order that ultimately tells the story of hedonistic abandon leading to spiritual crisis. \n\nThink of the new running order as one long night of partying and hedonism leading to a dawn of self-doubt, introspection, spiritual yearning, and existential ennui, culminating in a modern psalm ('Wake Up Dead Man').\n\nThis theme is further suggested by my new cover: an exploding disco ball! \n\nThe two tracks that were excised where, in my own opinion, better off as b-sides: Miami and The Playboy Mansion. These tracks were lyrically week and were interesting experiments but nothing more. In their place i put in Holy Joe (this track really underscores the spirit of the album), Big Girls Are Best (a sexy, hedonistic glam rock anthem), and I'm Not Your Baby (a statement of cocky defiance while out on the town).\n\nI have already released No Line On The Horizon REVISITED (do please check it out) and will be posting new versions of Rattle And Hum &amp; The Unforgettable Fire very shortly.\n\nHope you enjoy POP Revisited and, *please*, send your thoughts to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a6f394f4c3d0cfd5cfd2c3c2e6cbc7cfca88c5c9cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and share this with your fellow U2 fans! \n\n\n------------------------\n U2 - Pop REVISITED\n------------------------\n\n 1.
