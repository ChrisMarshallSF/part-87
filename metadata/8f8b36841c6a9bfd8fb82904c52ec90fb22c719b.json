Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f8b36841c6a9bfd8fb82904c52ec90fb22c719b","amp;dn":"FamilyStrokes+Cali+Sparks+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f8b36841c6a9bfd8fb82904c52ec90fb22c719b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,139,54,132,28,106,155,253,143,184,41,4,197,46,201,15,178,44,113,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
