She is the lover of Victor's lawyer and best friend Roman, but she can not divorce Victor since she signed a prenuptial contract that would leave her with only $10,000. Roman plots with Elizabeth to poison Victor with an experimental drug, but it fails and Victor is completely paralyzed without dying. During his autopsy with three medical students, Victor awakes from his comatose status, and totally deranged, he seeks revenge using his torture chamber. \n\nGenre:  Drama, Horror, Thriller\nDirector:     Erin Berry\nWriters:     Erin Berry, Leo Scherman (story)\nStars:      Kristy Swanson, Greg Bryk, Joshua Peace\nRelease Date:   12 December 2006 (USA)   \nCountry:    Canada\nLanguage:     English\nProduction Co:     235 Films, TwoThreeFive Productions\nRuntime:    85 min \nColor:    Color\nAspect Ratio:    1.85 : 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ccb61d6ca2e2bde9c2d02dc75784155c3344e3","amp;dn":"Living+Death+2006+DVDRiP.XViD-HoRRoRFReaKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ccb61d6ca2e2bde9c2d02dc75784155c3344e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,204,182,29,108,162,226,189,233,194,208,45,199,87,132,21,92,51,68,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
